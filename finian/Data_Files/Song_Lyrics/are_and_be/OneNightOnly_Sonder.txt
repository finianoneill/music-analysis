[Verse 1]
I'm flyin' out for the weekend
I'll be callin' you when I land
'Cause we ain't got no time to waste (ooh, ooh)
And I don't give a damn 'bout your boyfriend
He can have you when I go, next week, it might be Japan

[Bridge]
I know you been thinkin' 'bout me (ooh)
Thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me (I know you still think about me)
I know you been, thinkin' 'bout me
Thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me
I know you been, thinkin' 'bout me (ooh)
Thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me
I know you been, thinkin' 'bout me
Thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me (I'm in town)

[Chorus]
I'm in town for one night (one night), for one night only (one night only)
I came around (I came around) to put it down for one night only (just one night)
Got a room for me and you (I got a room) for one night only
We roll around for the last time, this is one night only

[Verse 2]
I'm flyin' out for the weekend
I'll be callin' you when I'm 'round
I wanna see you face to face (ooh, ooh)
And I don't give a damn about your boyfriend
He can have you after I go, I'ma do all I can (ooh)

[Bridge]
I know you been, thinkin' 'bout me (ooh)
Thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me
(I know you still think about me)
I know you been, thinkin' 'bout me (ooh)
Thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me
I know you been, thinkin' 'bout me (ooh)
Thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me (I'm in town)

[Chorus]
I'm in town for one night (one night), for one night only (one night only)
I came around (I came around) to put it down for one night only (just one night)
I got a room for me and you, (I got a room) for one night only
We roll around for the last time, this is one night only
