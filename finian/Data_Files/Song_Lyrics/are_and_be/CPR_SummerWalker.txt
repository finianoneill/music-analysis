[Verse 1]
Caught me at the right time baby (oh)
I was at the edge, I was at the end
Made me feel like there is life worth living
Made me feel alive oh yeah
Tell me I'm a sign

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby where would I be without your love beside me, oh
Baby where would I be? Probably gone, oh

[Refrain]
Cause it feels like CPR
Cause it feels like CPR

[Verse 2]
Mm, made me love again like
Notice this I can’t stand you, oh
I don’t wanna talk about it
Cause no one understands me no
You’re the only one I confide into darling, oh
I don’t even really need to lie to you babe

Place your love on all my pain
How you mince my heart oh darling
Everything I’ve done you knew you known
I ain’t really never had a home
Damn I really hate feeling alone
Maybe you can make me feel at home, baby

[Refrain]
I hate feeling alone
I hate feeling alone, baby oh
I hate feeling alone
I hate feeling alone, baby

I need you here at home, baby
You’re the only one who knows
You’re the only one who knows

Where would I be, be
