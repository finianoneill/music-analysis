[Verse 1]
You've got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we can make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Anyplace is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me myself I've got nothing to prove

[Verse 2]
You've got a fast car
I've got a plan to get us outta here
I've been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

[Verse 3]
See my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle that's the way it is
Says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My momma went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
Said somebody's gotta take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

[Pre-Chorus]
You've got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We've gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulders and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
And I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 4]
You got a fast car
We go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulders and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
And I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 5]
You've got a fast car
I've got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bars
See more your friends than you do your kids
I always hoped for better
That maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving

[Chorus]
So remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulders and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
And I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Outro]
You've got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?
You've gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
This way, yeah-eah-eah-eah, -eah
Mmmm
