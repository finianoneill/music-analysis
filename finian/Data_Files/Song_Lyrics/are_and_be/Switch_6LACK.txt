[Verse 1: 6LACK & Ty Dolla $ign]
I'm thinking 'bout a Yamaha (ayy)
I'm thinking 'bout a Yamaha
To get away from all the cameras
I'm over it, don't wanna fantasize
Fate is 'round the corner, right (Fate is 'round the corner right)
It hit me right between the eyes (Hit me right between the eyes)
It's funny when they switch and pick a side
Ain't nobody gotta go through what I'm going through, no
But it seems like they all know what I'm supposed to do so
Let's switch bodies for a day
You could me be and I could be you
Juggle the pile of shit that's bound to come through
You can have it since it's automatic

[Chorus: 6LACK & Ty Dolla $ign]
Now switch (switch)
Tell me how it feels (feels)
To be somebody else (else)
Now switch (switch)
It wasn't what you thought it was (was)
Another story to tell

[Post-Chorus: 6LACK]
Well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well
Well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
“So tell me lies, tell me lies, tell me lies
You and I ride or die, you and I
Entertain these other bitches and I will not
Entertain these other niggas, you know that
If I give you my heart, would you hold that?
Would you put it up safe or would you fold that?
If I find out you cheating me, just know that
I'ma kill you and that ho, ain't no going back”
That's what she told me, and how could I blame her?
A small town girl, now she all famous (switch)
Maybe it's my fault now, ain't like I've been livin' in the dark nah
I told you everything from the start
And you the one that had a change of heart
Girl, you can have it after all the damage

[Chorus: 6LACK & Ty Dolla $ign]
Now switch (switch)
Tell me how it feels (feels)
To be somebody else (else)
Now switch (switch)
It wasn't what you thought it was (was)
Another story to tell

[Post-Chorus: 6LACK]
Well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well
Well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well

[Outro: 6LACK]
I'm thinking I should speed it up
To get away from all the media
I'm human, don't you think I had enough?
My woman claiming that I switched on her
Only 'cause I hit a switch on her
She wasn't really good at keeping up
