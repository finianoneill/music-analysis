[Verse 1]
Everybody's talking about you and her together
How could you do that to me?
And everybody's talking about all the wonderful things you do with her
Like you used to with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't you tell by the look on my face?
I still like you that way
Now I can hardly remember why we ever lost ties
But I can tell
That I love you, and I still love you

[Chorus]
Long as I live (long as I, I can live)
I'll never get over (you getting over me)
It's killing me (it's killing me, killing me)
I'll never get over (you getting over me)

[Verse 2]
If you can't be with the one you really, truly love
Do the two step
Everybody's talking about you and her together
How could you do that to me?
And everybody's talking, everybody's going on about her
Like you used to with me

[Pre-Chorus]
I can tell by the look on your face
You really like her that way
And now I'm trying not to lose my mind and start crying
But I can tell
That you love her, you really love her

[Chorus]
Long as I live (long as I, I can live)
I'll never get over (you getting over me)
It's killing me (it's killing me, killing me)
I'll never get over (you getting over me)
Long as I live (long as I, I can live)
I'll never get over (you getting over me)
It's killing me (it's killing me, killing me)
I'll never get over (you getting over me)

[Bridge]
If you can't be with the one you love
It's okay
Cause if you can't be with the one you really, truly love
Do a two step

[Chorus]
Long as I live (long as I, I can live)
I'll never get over (you getting over me)
It's killing me (it's killing me, killing me)
I'll never get over (you getting over me)
Long as I live (long as I, I can live)
I'll never get over (you getting over me)
It's killing me (it's killing me, killing me)
I'll never get over (you getting over me)

[Outro]
If you can't be with the one you really, truly love
