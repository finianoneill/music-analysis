I remember when I was lost
Down for the count, was done
Yeah
No one around to pick me up
I was so over love
Till you came right in
And you brought me home

I ain't never felt this feeling

It's crazy
The way you've got the beat of my heart racing
Only love (only love!)
It will build you up
Bring you down
Only love
