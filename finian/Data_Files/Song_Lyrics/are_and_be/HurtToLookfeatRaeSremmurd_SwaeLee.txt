[Intro]
Lil ma, wanna come to the beach with me?
Let's go
Oh, woo
Yo, let's go, hey

[Chorus]
Summertime and it feels so good (hey)
Summertime and it feels so good
You got me high, dark clouds
Raining on me, raining on me
But you're like the summertime and it feels so good
You're like the summertime and it feels so good
You got me high

[Verse 1]
Running round, being famous
Living life, living life
Girl, I love that you're beautiful and aimless
But something don't feel right, oh
Why do I feel so low? (Why do I feel)
I'm surrounded by the beautiful
Said why do I feel so alone?
'Cause I know there's something wrong
Oh, I needed you

[Chorus]
Dark clouds, for the dark clouds
Raining on me, raining on me
Raining on me, oh (woo)
But you're like the summertime and it feels so good
You're like the summertime and it feels so good
You got me high

[Verse 2]
In the Jeep on the beach with the top down
Hits on the radio, turn it up so loud
So good, so good (it feels so good)
Sun is shining on my face
And designer be my shades
And I'm riding with my lady
It's feels amazing, feels amazing, ayy

[Bridge]
(Oh, woo, here we go, let's go)

[Chorus]
Summertime and it feels so good
You got me high

[Outro]
Running round, being famous
Living life, living life
Girl, I love that you're beautiful and aimless
But something don't feel right, oh
Why do I feel so low?
Said why do I feel so alone?
Oh, I needed you
