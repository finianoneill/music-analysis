[Verse 1: Vory]
I'm stuck in my ways and it's all because of women
Tried to steal my own mind away for meditation
We been through it all, girl but still we livin'
You tried to steal my own heart away, I know you feel me
Drop for me, mama
Drop it like it's hot for me, mama
Watch just how you talk to me, mama
Keep that lovin' on lock for me, mama yeah
Fuckin' with the kid, he a monster
Imma get your number, never call ya
And I know them other bitches gonna' try ya
With me, mama yeah

[Chorus 1: Vory]
(Say)
Say you know me better than I know myself
Say you know me but I didn't know myself
Say you know me better than I know myself

[Verse 2: Justine Skye]
I took my time away to let you know it
For you I did all these things, so I don't need to show it
I try, I try everything
But you claim you wasn't ready
So tell me who you kiddin'?
You out with all these women, oh
Not tryna hold ya, I drop it like it's hot for ya boy
Even though you're not with me, boy
Put it on the rocks for ya, boy
Put you on a night and
Bye bye, baby you lost it
Switch sides my home is cold and crazy
And I got nothing left to say

[Chorus 2: Justine Skye]
And how you know me, better than I know my
Better than I know myself, better than I know my
And how you know me, better than i know my
Better than I know myself, better than I know my
Know my, Know my

[Chorus 3: Vory]
How you know me, better than I know myself
How you know me, better than I know myself
How you know me, better than I know myself (yeah)
How you know me, better than I know myself (yeah, oh)
Better than I know myself
Better than I know myself
Better than I know myself
Say you know me?
