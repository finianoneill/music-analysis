[Intro: Lil Duval]
We gon' start this thing off right
Duval in the motherfuckin' house, c'mon, c'mon
Do it baby, stick it baby
Do it baby, stick it baby
Do it baby, stick it baby
Do it baby, stick it baby (smile bitch, smile bitch)
I'm living my best life, ain't goin back and forth with you niggas
I'm living my best life, ain't goin back and forth with you niggas
I'm living my best life, ain't goin back and forth with you niggas
Ain't goin back and forth with you niggas

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
You got a lot to be smilin' for (smile bitch, smile bitch, c'mon)
So what the fuck you be wilin' for? (smile bitch, smile bitch, c'mon)
I get my grin on
I'm smiling bitch, 'cause I always get my win on
I been on so many different stages
Graced the cover of a hundred magazine pages
Made people smile everywhere that I went
I even put it on the first Black President
It's evident, I'm hot as a Crock-Pot
With a big-ass smile like Mr. Hot Spot

[Pre-Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Lil Duval]
You got a lot to be smilin' for
Smile bitch, smile bitch, c'mon!
So what the fuck you be wilin' for?
Smile bitch, smile bitch, c'mon!
If you breathin', you achievin'
Smile bitch, smile bitch, c'mon!

Smile bitch, smile bitch, c'mon!
Smile bitch, smile bitch, c'mon!

[Chorus: Lil Duval]
I'm living my best life
I ain't goin' back and forth with you niggas
I'm living my best life
I ain't goin' back and forth with you niggas
I'm living my best life
I ain't goin' back and forth with you niggas
I'm living my best life
I ain't goin' back and forth with you niggas

[Verse 2: Ball Greezy]
Put your middle fingers up in the air
And show a hater you ain't even once cared
We finna get another bag this year
My ex bitch, you can have that there
This year, bad vibes get cut off
More trips, new chicks with no drawers
More drank, more smoke, and more cars
More shows with Duval and Snoop Dogg
Look, I ain't tryna throw no shade
'Cause I can't see 'em in my lane
As long as my rent gettin' paid
I can care less what a bitch think (huh)

[Pre-Chorus: Ball Greezy & Lil Duval]
You in the club every night with no job
Smile bitch, smile bitch, c'mon!
Eatin' good off your foodstamp card
Smile bitch, smile bitch, c'mon!
You made a killin' last year off fraud
Smile bitch, smile bitch, c'mon!
If you know you ain't goin' to work tomorr'
Smile bitch, smile bitch, c'mon!
Ha-ha, smile bitch, smile bitch
Smile bitch, smile bitch, c'mon!

[Chorus: Lil Duval]
I'm living my best life
I ain't goin' back and forth with you niggas
(smile bitch, smile bitch, c'mon)
I'm living my best life
I ain't goin' back and forth with you niggas
(smile bitch, smile bitch, c'mon)
I'm living my best life
I ain't goin' back and forth with you niggas
(smile bitch, smile bitch, c'mon)
I'm living my best life
I ain't goin' back and forth with you niggas
(smile bitch, smile bitch, c'mon)

[Outro: Lil Duval]
Smile bitch, smile bitch, c'mon!
