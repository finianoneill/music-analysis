[Chorus]
You can feel it in the streets
On a day like this, the heat
It feel like summer
I feel like summer
I feel like summer
You can feel it in the streets
On a day like this, the heat
I feel like summer
She feel like summer
This feel like summer
I feel like summer

[Verse 1]
Seven billion souls that move around the sun
Rolling faster, faster and not a chance to slow down
Slow down
Men who made machines that want what they decide
Parents tryna tell their children please slow down
Slow down

[Pre-Chorus]
I know
Oh, I know you know that pain
I'm hopin' that this world will change
But it just seems the same
(It is not the same)

[Chorus]
You can feel it in the streets
On a day like this, the heat
It feels like summer
(I feel like summer)
I feel like summer
(I feel like summer)
I feel like summer


[Verse 2]
Every day gets hotter than the one before
Running out of water, it's about to go down
Go down
Air that kill the bees that we depend upon
Birds were made for singing
Waking up to no sound
No sound

[Pre-Chorus]
I know
Oh, I know you know my pain
I'm hopin' that this world will change
But it just seems the same
I know
Oh, I hope we change
I really thought this world would change
But it seems like the same

[Outro]
I know
Oh, my mind is still the same
I'm hoping that this world will change
But it just seems the same
I know
Oh, I hope we change
