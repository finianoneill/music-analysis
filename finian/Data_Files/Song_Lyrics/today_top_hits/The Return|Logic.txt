Satisfy this hungriness (6ix)

[Verse 1]
Hold up let me get up in it now
Bitch, I'm here to win it now
L-O-G-I-C, I'm feeling free, I'm finna bring it now
If you know the words, take a step back and sing it now
Never thought I'd have to, but I keep the windows tinted now
Like, la-di-da-di, who got the keys to my Audi?
Last time I said, it went viral, I don't fuck with nobody
And I don't fuck with you, you, them, her and him too
'Cause don't none of y'all know a fucking thing 'bout what I been through
And all that superficial shit you love I'm just not into
And when it comes to gettin' deep in this rap shit I've been to
Like the pussy, don't push me
I ain't no killer, but you know the rest
You think I caught the holy spirit how I'm feelin' blessed
Ain't no contest to all this wack shit, it just ain't no test
Step and get laid to rest, boy, step and get laid to rest
And ain't no "S" on my chest but I'm still gunnin'
While half of these motherfuckers still runnin'
I've earned everything I've attained and they steal from him
Like goddamn, I'm the motherfuckin' man
Used to call you a hater, you a motherfuckin' stan
Ain't nobody built himself a brand like me
I ain't signed a shoe deal 'cause I'm waitin' for Nike
To recognize all these youngins wanna be just like me
Cut the check for twenty million right now and we might see
Everybody rockin' my kicks, preachin' positivity
I get up, I get up

[Chorus]
I get up, when I'm down, had enough, almost drowned
When shit rough I get tough and when I'm beaten to the ground
I get up, I get up
I get up, uh, uh, I get up, uh, uh
I get up, when I'm down, had enough, almost drowned
When shit rough I get tough and when I'm beaten to the ground
I get up, I get up
I get up, uh, uh, I get up, uh, uh
I get up

[Verse 2]
Never address me as "Robert" 'less it's about that Dinero
Far from a hero, I ain't never savin' hoes
I'm not defined by these clothes, and zeros
It don't matter if you got six dollars or six figures on the creep
'Cause in the end we all six feet deep
Meanwhile, I'll be immortalized on the 6ix beat
Flashbacks and havin' visions way back in G'Burg
Every single one of my homies and me work
Cuttin' had to get up out it, make a hit, forget about it
Youngin' wit' a dream but nobody gave a shit about it
Ten years later, pick up a pen, write a hit about it
And back then I thought I'd be defined by how good I rhyme
Not like these rappers with shit flows, but look good online
Not made to feel bad for speakin' bout this shit on my mind
Or called a faggot, a nigger, a cracker who wish he was blacker
I wish I could face my homophobic, racist attacker
And smack the shit outta they ass as peaceful as possible
It's highly improbable, it's stoppable
But still, way too many people feel how I feel
That's on the real, on the real, on the motherfuckin' real

[Chorus]
I get up, when I'm down, had enough, almost drowned
When shit rough I get tough and when I'm beaten to the ground
I get up, I get up
I get up, uh, uh, I get up, uh, uh
I get up, when I'm down, had enough, almost drowned
When shit rough I get tough and when I'm beaten to the ground
I get up, I get up
I get up, uh, uh, I get up, uh, uh

[Verse 3]
Ayo motherfucker, Trump, said that shit on my last album but you wasn't tapping in
Fuck a mumble let's make America rap again
Industry don't give a fuck about rap or what's happenin'
Fuck a Hypebeast, bitch, now who seein' me?
Nobody reports the music, this shit, this rap TMZ
Nowadays everyone divided, so I collided with headlines
Preach that, go 'head boy now preach that
Wash my hands of this negativity, word to Three Stacks
So fresh, so clean, who the illest on the scene?
Wu-Tang, get the cream, Sinatra gon' reign supreme
Open your mental, get out your feelin's like dental
This shit is consequential, lightin' a fire to the game
Can you rappers feel the flame?
Nah, this shit won't be the same
Fuck a rap beef, I promise I want all of y'all to prosper
But deep down you know it's only gon' be one Mufasa
I'm the king, fuck the bling, but just might make you kiss the ring
All these rappers I came up on, I surpassed, I know it sting now
Don't try to twist my words and turn that into some shit
I love all you motherfuckers, just want to hear you spit
Dropped my last shit, the whole wide world applauded it
Game still ain't give me my credits, so I'ma audit it
I'm heartless like Kanye in '08
Yeah, that's word to NO I.D
Now they all know who I be
I'm callin' out Jay-Z to jump up on the track with me and smack the whole industry
Show 'em what that real rap do
The ball's in your court, Hov, I hope to hear from Guru, woo!
