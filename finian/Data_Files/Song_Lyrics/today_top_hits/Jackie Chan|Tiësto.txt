[Intro]
Ooh...

[Verse 1]
Every butterfly I get belongs to you
You don't believe me but it's true
Sure, the freckles on my arm spell out your name
Real feelings coming through
'Cause all I know and all I am is you, ooh...
Yeah, all I know and all I am is you, ooh...

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm breaking my silence
'Cause I've had a few
I just can't deny it
That all I know and all I am is you

[Chorus]
Every time I think I'm falling
I know you're falling too
There's no doubt you're all in (oh oh oh oh)
If you ever think you're falling
You know I'll catch you too, oh, oh
'Cause all I am is you

[Break]
Ooh...
Ooh...

[Verse 2]
Every daydream I have starts and ends with you
I wanna play it one more time, hey
When I need an alibi, you're my perfect excuse
You are always on my side
'Cause all I know and all I am is you, ooh...

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm breaking my silence
'Cause I've had a few
I just can't deny it
That all I know and all I am is you

[Chorus]
Every time I think I'm falling
I know you're falling too
There's no doubt you're all in (oh oh oh oh)
If you ever think you're falling
You know I'll catch you too, oh, oh
All I am is you

[Bridge]
It feels like I'm miles away
You bring me back home again
You hold me through my mistakes
Let go as we start again
You're a habit I'll never break
No no, no no, no ooh!

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm breaking my silence
'Cause I've had a few
I just can't deny it (oh, no)
That all I know and all I am is you (oh whoa oh!)

[Chorus]
Every time I think I'm falling
I know you're falling too
There's no doubt you're all in (oh oh oh oh, oh ah...)
If you ever think you're falling
You know I'll catch you too, oh, oh
All I am (oh)

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause all I know and all I am is you, ooh...
Yeah, all I know and all I am is you, ooh...
'Cause all I know and all I am is you, ooh...
Yeah, all I know and all I am is you
