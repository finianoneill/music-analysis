[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Nigga for real, for real
My niggas is real, for real
I'm in the field for real
I'm 'bout my check for real
I'm 'bout my respect for real
My diamonds are crystal clear
I'm shining from ear to ear

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Roll with the paper, see them lames later
Can't save her, her nigga stepped out, now she sayin' what she really think
Rollin' up pounds of dank
Open accounts, no matter where we at, smoking there and back
Eyes barely open, not never smokin'
Hit her once and she choke
2 K's, that means it's potent
Can't overdose but my strain explosive
Trained to go, my chain, it glow
Everything you see, I paid for
Gang or croak

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Lil Skies]
Nigga for real, for real
My niggas is real, for real
I'm in the field, for real
I'm 'bout my check, for real
I'm 'bout my respect, for real
My diamonds are crystal clear
I'm shining from ear to ear
Nigga for real, for real
My niggas is real, for real
I'm in the field, for real
I'm 'bout my check, for real
I'm 'bout my respect, for real
My diamonds are crystal clear (they clear)
I'm shining from ear to ear

[Verse 2: Lil Skies]
I'm shinin' from ear to ear
Stand my ground, I ain't showin' no fear
I done came up like the top of the stairs
These niggas hate 'cause they cannot compare, aw shit
I'm in the crowd with the mosh pit
I hit the stage and they show tits
I'm in the game, I can't forfeit
Honestly, I'ma make more hits
Hop in the coupe and I swerve in your lady
She gave me top because I am the greatest
I stayed the same and then came all the changes
You wanna know what it's like to be famous
Rollin' up weed in public (public)
Skies be on all of that fuck shit (that fuck shit)
I'm ballin' bitch, like I got buckets (got buckets)
And they hate 'cause we stunt like nothing, biatch!

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Lil Skies]
Nigga for real, for real (for real)
My niggas is real, for real (for real)
I'm in the field for real (for real)
I'm 'bout my check for real (for real)
I'm 'bout my respect for real (let's go)
My diamonds are crystal clear (uh-huh)
I'm shining from ear to ear (cash, cash)
Nigga for real, for real
My niggas is real, for real
I'm in the field for real
I'm 'bout my check for real
I'm 'bout my respect for real
My diamonds are crystal clear
I'm shining from ear to ear

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah
I'm 'bout the bag, for real
I'm 'bout that cash, for real
Shawty got ass, for real (pssh)
If it's no mask, it's for real
I want that gas, for real
My niggas trap for real
Run in the game
You speak on me, put "Big Homie" in front of my name
For every one of you lames
Y'all unoriginal niggas, they all sound the same
I stay ballin', money like a faucet
It stay runnin', runnin', runnin'
I can't call it, got the bug
I think they caught it
I'm with bosses

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Nigga for real, for real
My niggas is real, for real
I'm the field for real
I'm 'bout my check for real
I'm 'bout my respect for real
My diamonds are crystal clear
I'm shining from ear to ear
Nigga for real, for real
My niggas is real, for real
I'm the field for real
I'm 'bout my check for real
I'm 'bout my respect for real
My diamonds are crystal clear
I'm shining from ear to ear
