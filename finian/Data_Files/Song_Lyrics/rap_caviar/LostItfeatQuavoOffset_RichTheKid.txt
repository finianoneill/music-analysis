[Bridge: Travis Scott]
Ballin' like I'm in the NBA
No, these racks cannot see TSA
They found me, now I have to relocate

[Chorus: Travis Scott & NAV]
Finna take off on spaceship (spaceship)
Dodgin' these hoes like Matrix (Matrix)
Ain't fuckin' her unless she nameless
'Cause the last two was too famous (famous)
We got that trophy like a champion
Fell asleep right on a jet, we gone
Big rings just like a champion
No TSA, hop on a jet, we gone

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Smash out, I call my hoe and then I smash out
I brought my bros, let's get this cash out
Eye in my mind, drop the bag off, bag off, yeah
I'm going Tom Brady, ain't made no bad call
Just bought a new crib, old one was mad-small
I triple my cup, I make it mad tall, mad tall
None of these hoes is basic, yeah
Grease stuck in my teeth like braces, yeah
VVS's, don't need Lasik, yeah
Iced-out crosses, freezing Satan, yeah

[Chorus: Travis Scott & NAV]
Finna take off on spaceship (spaceship)
Dodgin' these hoes like Matrix (Matrix)
Ain't fuckin' her unless she nameless
'Cause the last two was too famous (famous)
We got that trophy like a champion
Fell asleep right on a jet, we gone
Big rings just like a champion
No TSA, hop on a jet, we gone

[Verse 2: NAV]
Fucked a famous girl to "Mask Off" (Molly, Percocet)
Pop a bean an' let the bags talk
Bought ten bottles on a last call (last call)
Flew a basic girl out from Alaska
Illegal alien inside my spaceship
Two Cs on my shoes, these not no ASICS
Get out my face, my pockets full of faces
Bust down gold AP, that's not no stainless (yahh)
My Rollie told me what the day is
I like her 'cause she basic, she got braces
Her followers 100k, then she too famous
If she got a thousand, might make her my main bitch, yeah

[Chorus: Travis Scott & NAV]
Finna take off on spaceship (spaceship)
Dodgin' these hoes like Matrix (Matrix)
Ain't fuckin' her unless she nameless
'Cause the last two was too famous (famous)
We got that trophy like a champion
Fell asleep right on a jet, we gone
Big rings just like a champion
No TSA, hop on a jet, we gone
We got that trophy like a champion
Fell asleep right on a jet, we gone
Big rings just like a champion
No TSA, hop on a jet, we gone

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
Ballin' like I'm in the NBA
No, these racks cannot see TSA
They found me, now I have to relocate
