Uh, yeah, I bought a 'Claren (woo)

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Chain so big, should have came with a kick stand
Fuck with me, I got a retainer on a hit man (bop)
Barely came up out the mud like quicksand (barely)
I show you how to get millions, nigga, that's a mil plan, now
Uh, yeah, ring the alarm, Cartier bracelets on all of my arms
Uh, yeah, halo my son, in the wheelchair, and I still perform (uh)

You set it off like Cleo, I set it off like Boosie

[Verse 2: Drake & Quavo]
Young champagne checkin' in, man, Tity Boi shit ringin' off
'Member I was on pre-paid, I would act like my shit was ringin' off
'Member shorty told me she thought the raps good but the singing's off
Watch on Young Dro now, man, boi-oing shit blingin' off
Where the racks at? (racks)
All I know is they keep comin' to me like a flashback, nigga, what? (what?)
Half a million out in Vegas, it ain't no blackjack, nigga, naw (naw)

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Touchscreen on my cars, vintage one to two
I just bought a watch that's plain like a Dickie suit (plain)
I sip some red wine, and chased it with the '42
They asked me what I call millions, comin' soon
Yeah (yeah), I just cashed out (uh)
Ain't got time for a beef, I'm a cash cow (tell 'em)
When I was in juvie, I made 'em back out (back that ass up)
It was 400 degrees, you would have passed out (ooh)

[Chorus: Quavo & 2 Chainz]
Uh, yeah, baller alert
Lil biddy bitch I don't call her alert (brrrrp)
Uh, yeah, follow alert
Go get the fire when I'm callin' 'em merked (yeaaaah)
Uh, yeah, profit come first
I whip the baby, the baby gon' birth (whip it)
Uh, yeah, I bought a 'Claren (woo)
I bought a 'Claren, didn't wanna buy verts, uh
This shit bigger than you (hey)
I'm takin' on a new path (uh)
Making the bricks take a bath (woo)
Lil biddy bitch, do the math (yeah)
Lil nigga, who are you? (who you?)
Must be bulletproof (brrrp) (bye)
This shit bigger than you (it big)
