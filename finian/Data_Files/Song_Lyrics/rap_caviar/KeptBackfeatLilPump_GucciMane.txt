[Intro: Gucci Mane & Lil Pump]
Huh, It's Gucci
Ooh
Huh, Wop, whah
Lil Pump
Brr, yeah, blah, oh, blow
M-M-M-Murda

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Murda on the beat with the murder man
Ben Simmons shake 'em with the left hand
Steppin' on his dope like a step dad
Too turnt up, can't help that
Shittin' on a hater no Ex-Lax
Watch so dumb it got kept back
Bitch so thick, she can't help that
'Cause she livin' out the jet, got jet-lag
Need a real boss bitch, I can't help that
And her brain so dumb we got kept back
Just flew in designer to the bookbag
Tell her needed something real good to look at
Booty so big it got kept back
Pull up in the don, let the roof back
Don't tell me that you love me, baby prove that
Chain keep flickin' and the gang keeps spending

[Verse 1: Lil Pump]
Got a lot of ice on my neck man
Damn man, hundred bands hangin' on my backpack
Wrist so cold need a ice pack
Put four hundred bands in the mic stand
Woke up in the morning, bought a Maybach
Ooh, I'ma go do what I want to do
Got your baby mama, nigga tokin' out the sunroof
Damn boo, I'ma keep it real, I don't fuck with you
'Cause you got an attitude
You cashed out on a Bentley Coupe (woo)
I'ma go and fuck your bitch tomor-row
Gucci loafers on when I walk, dough
Lil Pump smash your main ho (wow)
And she gon' do what I say so
I'ma show you how I live life, ooh
Made two mil in one night
Whole body covered in ice
Pourin' up fours in my Tropical Sprite

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Murda on the beat with the murder man
Ben Simmons shake 'em with the left hand
Steppin' on his dope like a step dad
Too turnt up, can't help that
Shittin' on a hater no Ex-Lax
Watch so dumb it got kept back
Bitch so thick, she can't help that
'Cause she livin' out the jet, got jet-lag
Need a real boss bitch, I can't help that
And her brain so dumb we got kept back
Just flew in designer to the bookbag
Tell her needed something real good to look at
Booty so big it got kept back
Pull up in the don, let the roof back
Don't tell me that you love me, baby prove that
Chain keep flickin' and the gang keeps spending

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Nigga keep missin' with the music
Baby you a human jacuzzi
I'ma twist a bitch like a rubix
I might turn my book into a movie (Gucci)
I'ma put a bitch in a movie, porno
Rockstar couple, Cher, Bono
Rock star my life, Muliano
Pull up, ten bricks of that Nelly Furtado
El Gato's down in The Hamptons
My bitch with blue hair, Marge Simpson
Pull up with the driver in a Phantom
Pinky ring sick, it got cancer
I was just sellin' dope on camera
Now I got my own shoe like the Answer
Might pull up throw some money on a dancer
Had to tip my earrings 'cause they dancin'

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Murda on the beat with the murder man
Ben Simmons shake 'em with the left hand
Steppin' on his dope like a step dad
Too turnt up, can't help that
Shittin' on a hater no Ex-Lax
Watch so dumb it got kept back
Bitch so thick, she can't help that
'Cause she livin' out the jet, got jet-lag
Need a real boss bitch, I can't help that
And her brain so dumb we got kept back
Just flew in designer to the bookbag
Tell her needed something real good to look at
Booty so big it got kept back
Pull up in the don, let the roof back
Don't tell me that you love me, baby prove that
Chain keep flickin' and the gang keeps spending
