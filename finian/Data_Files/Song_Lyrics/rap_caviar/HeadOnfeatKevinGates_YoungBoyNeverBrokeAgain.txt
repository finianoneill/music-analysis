[Intro: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Bitch, yeah, I

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Run up a check, make that lil ho give me neck, uh
Hop off a jet, lookin' to see where I'm at, uh
Over two bodies we done stretched, got her head on wet
Rip my pockets, I can't let, got her head on bet, uh

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Whole lot of hoes I done met
Talk like he 'bout it, I'm spinnin' 'bout that
Girl in my pocket, I'm wringin' her neck
Move like a goddess, stay with a chopper, uh
Let me see can you catch?
Make yo' ho go fetch, she say roger that, yeah
Big face, stupid stacks, I got a lot of that
Who you fuckin' and suckin', I'm lovin' that
Tell the truth, you don't got lie 'bout that
If you ask me, I tell you, I throw a fact
Bend it over, I want you to throw it back
Take a shot and they know we gon' send 'em back
Wet a block in a day boy, I been on that, yeah

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Run up a check, make that lil bitch give me neck, uh
Hop off a jet, lookin' to see where I'm at, uh
Over two bodies we done stretched, got her head on wet
Rip my pockets, I can't let, got her head on bet

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Walk in and flex, women be breakin' they neck
Callin' correct, used to be call and collect
Don't like to text, need to get in your face, where you at?
Shittin' hard, got a stain on your chest, no Lambo, whippin' the 'Vette
Strap Rambo up in the TEC, commando runnin' the checks
Eyes on, we been goin' off, gotta switch cars for to throw 'em off
Cookin' the yay, this without workin' a sweat
And I been tellin' Kentrell, go 'til we run out of breath
He say bet

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Run up a check, make that lil bitch give me neck, uh
Hop off a jet, lookin' to see where I'm at, uh
Over two bodies we done stretched, got her head on wet
Rip my pockets, I can't let, got her head on bet
Run up a check, make that lil bitch give me neck, uh
Hop off a jet, lookin' to see where I'm at, uh
Over two bodies we done stretched, got her head on wet
Rip my pockets, I can't let, got her head on bet, uh
