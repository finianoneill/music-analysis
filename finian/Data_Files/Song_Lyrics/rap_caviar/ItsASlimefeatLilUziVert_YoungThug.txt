[Intro: Young Thug]
I got Lil Ian in this motherfucker with me, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah
Wheezy outta here

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Yeah, I just bought a drop
Shit, I took off the top
Shit, I fucked on a thot
Shit, I kicked the bitch out
Yeah, I aim to the past
Yeah, I took all the packs
Shit, 'cause nigga I'm slime
Shit, you say that's your kind
Yeah, I know when it's time
I add up the wins, it's a dime
You lock 'em up, let 'em back out
You feedin' these pigs rhymes
You know that I switch and resigns
You know I come quick with designs
My homie done whip it a nine
Inside the car green, it's a slime

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Woo, yeah
Shit, inside the car green, it's a slime
My latest ho Saint Laurent
I pay her to make the blunt
I throw me a ten, I'm done
I'm fuckin' her friend for somethin'
I take the doors off the Wraith to the top
I'm in the space Jeep for somethin'
Got a tall Asian drink, sippin' red bitch
Put the blue on the floor like a Maverick
Take care all my bitches, I ain't selfish
Hands off a tycoon, where's your manners?

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Yeah, I just bought a drop
Shit, I took off the top
Shit, I fucked on a thot
Shit, I kicked the bitch out
Yeah, I aim to the past
Yeah, I took all the packs
Shit, 'cause nigga I'm slime
Shit, you say that's your kind
Yeah, I know when it's time
I add up the wins, it's a dime
You lock 'em up, let 'em back out
You feedin' these pigs rhymes
You know that I switch and resigns
You know I come quick with designs
My homie done whip it a nine
Inside the car green, it's a slime

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
Okay, I'm a lil cooler
Uh, yeah, slime a lil booler
Uh, okay I don't need a shooter
Uh, I got a Glock with a ruler
These are not pointed baguettes
Her pussy wet like my neck
Uh, ain't gon' love no more pussy, I'ma go connect
I put a Z on a brand new, all red, long Corvette (vroom)
I got hoes like the muzzle on a brand new TEC
I gotta leave you, it's nice to meet you (it's nice to meet you)
I was on Cleveland (I was on Cleveland)
Oop, I mean Bleveland (oop, I mean Bleveland)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Yeah, I just bought a drop
Shit, I took off the top
Shit, I fucked on a thot
Shit, I kicked the bitch out
Yeah, I aim to the past
Yeah, I took all the packs
Shit, 'cause nigga I'm slime
Shit, you say that's your kind
Yeah, I know when it's time
I add up the wins, it's a dime
You lock 'em up, let 'em back out
You feedin' these pigs rhymes
You know that I switch and resigns
You know I come quick with designs
My homie done whip it a nine
Inside the car green, it's a slime
