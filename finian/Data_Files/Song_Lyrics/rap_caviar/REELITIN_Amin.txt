[Intro]
Right now!

[Chorus]
Reel it in
I got the bag, tell a friend
She got some ass, bring it in
Bitch I'm the news, CNN (yeah)
Reel it in
I got the bag, tell a friend
She got some ass, bring it in
Bitch I'm the news, CNN (yeah) (hey!)

[Verse 1]
Drippin'
Rollie got the tick tock missin'
Bitch pimpin' (ayy)
Broke niggas got me livid (wow)
You Jordan or Pippen (true)
I'm Kobe I'm never gon' dish it
(Or miss it)
I'm business as fuck and I ain't got the time to just kick it

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't trust nobody 'cause I can't be fake
Frontin' ain't an option 'cause my soul can't change
And I'm tired of being humble, bitch I feel no way
It's that young nigga shit, I might pull up to your bitch like

[Chorus]
Reel it in (whoo!)
I got the bag, tell a friend (hoo)
She got some ass, bring it in (ayy)
Bitch I'm the news, CNN (yeah, yeah)
Reel it in
I got the bag, tell a friend (hoo)
She got some ass, bring it in
Bitch I'm the news, CNN

[Verse 2]
Jesus Christ! (Hallelujah!)
I buy that shit before I even know the price (hey!)
This 13K up on my finger, bitch you right (true)
Them diamonds dancin', yeah that boy be lookin' nice (ayy)
I guess that's what you call that motherfuckin' ice
I got a thotiana, put her in designer
She Italiana, she a sorta kinda
She Bj√∂rk cute, so she really fine
Just sorta weird, and she got some cake
Gimme OPB for my ODB, these APC, do your ABC's
I'm a young dread-head with anxiety
And I love it when a bitch nigga tryin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't trust nobody 'cause I can't be fake
Frontin' ain't an option 'cause my soul can't change
And I'm tired of being humble, bitch I feel no way
It's that young nigga shit, I might pull up to your bitch like

[Chorus]
Reel it in
I got the bag, tell a friend
She got some ass, bring it in
Bitch I'm the news, CNN (yeah)

[Outro]
Reel it in
I got the bag, tell a friend
She got some ass, bring it in
Bitch I'm the news, CNN (yeah)
