[Intro: Smokepurpp & Valee]
Lil Purpp!
I'ma paint, on her face like I'm DoodleBob
Jump in, that pussy like I scuba dive
Boy don't test your luck, could be the day that you finna die
AK-47 'round my arm like a shoulder pad
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney!
Ooh, huh?
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Woah

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
If I see you, I'ma wet you, hit you and your nephew
Came in with a big drum, wet you like a stencil
L-line a nigga up just like a pencil (like a pencil)
L-l-let you hold my flow, yeah I just blessed you (just blessed you)
I just fucked up five racks, dropped it on a jacket (on a jacket)
Yoppa fold a nigga like a pamphlet (brrat, brrat)
Uzi make 'em JuJu, he thought it was voodoo (hit them, folks)
F-f-fuck the bitch one time, she said that I'm rude (I'm rude)

[Verse 1: Smokepurpp]
Serving to my auntie, yeah, she a good custy (auntie custy)
She know that I'm keeping that good musty
Serving to my uncle, my weed looking fluffy (ooh, ooh)
Yeah my uncle a good custy (Lil Purpp!)
I'ma paint, on her face like I'm DoodleBob
Jump in, that pussy like I scuba dive
Boy don't test your luck, could be the day that you finna die
AK-47 'round my arm like a shoulder pad
All these chains around my neck, bitch I'm dripping
Six grams in a blunt, and I'm sippin'
Bitch, I get them birdies and I put them in the kitchen
VVS on my Rollie and the Cuban, call me FitBit

[Chorus: Smokepurpp & Lil Pump]
If I see you, I'ma wet you, hit you and your nephew (brrat, brrat)
Came in with a big drum, wet you like a stencil (brrat, brrat)
L-line a nigga up just like a pencil (like a pencil)
L-l-let you hold my flow, yeah I just blessed you (just blessed you)
I just fucked up five racks, dropped it on a jacket (on a jacket)
Yoppa fold a nigga like a pamphlet (yeah, brrat, brrat)
Uzi make 'em JuJu (ooh), he thought it was voodoo (hit them, folks)
F-f-fuck the bitch one time, she said that I'm rude (I'm rude)

[Verse 2: Lil Pump]
My grandma got a face tat, auntie on probation (damn)
Bitch I'm in the hood, servin' junkies in a Maybach (Maybach)
Sold your kid some heroin, spilled lean on my dreadlocks (god damn)
Shoot you and your grandson, knock your nephew head off
Nick bag, dime bag, sell it on the corner (corner)
Before you suck my dick you better sign a non-disclosure
Uber driver took me to the trap in a Toyota (Uber!)
God damn, yeah, you flexin' 'cause my name is Lil Pump
Bitch you very ugly, please don't ask me for no tip (no tip)
I'm a millionaire, but I'll Uber pool a bitch (ooh)
I just dropped like 30 Xannies (Xanax) in a sip jar
I'm a rockstar, got some top at lobby at the ALoft

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
If I see you, I'ma wet you, hit you and your nephew (brrat, brrat)
Came in with a big drum, wet you like a stencil (brrat, brrat)
L-line a nigga up just like a pencil (like a pencil)
L-l-let you hold my flow, yeah I just blessed you (just blessed you)
I just fucked up five racks, dropped it on a jacket (on a jacket)
Yoppa fold a nigga like a pamphlet (brrat, brrat)
Uzi make 'em JuJu, he thought it was voodoo (hit them, folks)
F-f-fuck the bitch one time, she said that I'm rude (I'm rude)
