With a voice just like a razor
Only time can erase ya
The memory of you is unclear
In my rear view you disappear
When familiar turns foreign
You know there's discord in the chorus
Usually I would've folded but

But not tonight
Ain't gonna be alone, ain't gonna be alone
But not tonight
Ain't gonna be alone, ain't gonna be alone, oh

I, I, I... I, I
Cause I owe you, you, you
Yeah, I owe you, you, you
And I'm talking about you, you, you
I'm talking about you, you, you

Oh I want to hear your story
Whilst I work through your inventory
Your one-liners leave a shiner
You're not sober, and I'm not either
Oh, I wouldn't say I'm perfect
You can tell that from the surface
But I'd like to know your verdict, oh

Cause tonight
Yeah, I wanna take you home
Yeah, I wanna take you home
Cause tonight
Shouldn't have to be alone
Shouldn't have to be alone, oh

I, I, I... I, I
Cause I owe you, you, you
Yeah, I owe you, you, you
And I'm talking about you, you, you
I'm talking about you, you, you

Your decision for, my admission
Was a plot twist, I must have missed it
Now that we're a work in progress
I guess that I should be honest
I don't know, where this will go
But I owe you

Cause I owe you, you, you
Yeah, I owe you, you, you
And I'm talking about you, you, you
And I'm talking about you, you, you
