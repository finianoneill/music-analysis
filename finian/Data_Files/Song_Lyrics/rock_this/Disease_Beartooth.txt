[Verse 1]
If I fall again, will it be the end?
I know it's wrong
You think I'm strong, but I just pretend
Is it taking over?
Will it bury me?
Or will clarity become the cure for my disease?

[Verse 2]
Stuck at the surface
Not making progress
Falling apart
Well I'm trying my hardest
Looking for answers
Finding a rope
Is the noose getting tighter?
I'm losing control

[Pre-Chorus]
Will the end make me whole again?

[Chorus]
It's like holding on
When my grip is lost
I still feed my insecurity when I know the cost
Is it taking over?
Will it bury me?
Or will clarity become the cure for my disease?

[Verse 3]
I'm getting older
Still lost as ever
Faking a smile while I bury the pressure
Why does this happen?
I should be fine
But I can't shake the feeling I'm living a lie

[Pre-Chorus]
Will the end make me whole again?

[Chorus]
It's like holding on
When my grip is lost
I still feed my insecurity when I know the cost
Is it taking over?
Will it bury me?
Or will clarity become the cure for my disease?

[Verse 1]
If I fall again, will it be the end?
I know it's wrong
You think I'm strong but I just pretend
Is it taking over?
Will it bury me?
Or will clarity become the cure for my disease?

[Chorus]
It's like holding on
When my grip is lost
I still feed my insecurity when I know the cost
Is it taking over?
Will it bury me?
Or will clarity become the cure for my disease?
(Become the cure for my disease)
