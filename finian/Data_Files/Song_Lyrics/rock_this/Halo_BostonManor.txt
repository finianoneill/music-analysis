[Verse 1: Henry Cox]
Here we are again
A thick brown belt's on my arm again
A table spoon full of tar again
I've let go and it never felt so good
I've sold out my friends
And ruined my life over again
My energy and my money's spent

[Chorus: Henry Cox]
I can see your halo fall, halo fall
I can see your halo fall
'Cause I had it, then I lost it all

[Verse 2: Henry Cox]
Cold sweats in the morning
Real life's become boring
I've tripped and I'm falling
But I'll stop tomorrow
Can you catch the feeling?
A small wet cloth to stem the bleeding
The scars on my arms are barely healing

[Chorus: Henry Cox]
I can see your halo fall, halo fall
I can see your halo fall
'Cause I had it, then I lost it all

[Bridge: Henry Cox]
(Just a quick fix then I'll get clean)
(Just a quick fix then I'll get clean)

[Chorus: Henry Cox]
I can see your halo fall, halo fall
I can see your halo fall
'Cause I had it, then I lost it all

[Chorus: Henry Cox]
I can see your halo fall, halo fall
I can see your halo fall
'Cause I had it, then I lost it all
