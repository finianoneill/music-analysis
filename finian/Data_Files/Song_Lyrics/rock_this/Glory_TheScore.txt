[Intro]
(Glory!)
(Glory!)

[Verse 1]
This is not another story
This is not another drill
I refuse to be another number now
Never staying down
This is something real
I'm a name that you'll remember
I am more than just a thrill
I am gonna be the greatest ever now
Watch out
I'm a force that you will fear

[Pre-Chorus]
And it goes something like (Woo-oooh)
I'm victorious (Woo-oooh)
It's my time (Woo-oooh)
There's no stopping this
'Cause I was born for this

[Chorus]
I do it for the glory
(Wo-oh-ooh-oh, woo-oh-oooh)
I do it for the glory
(Woo-ooh-oooh)

[Verse 2]
I'll be more than just a fable
I'll be written in the stars
I will never be too afraid to bleed
Giving up on me
Even when it's hard
Oh, I started as an ember
Who was never carelessly
And now I'm raging like a fire
Burning up through everything I see

[Pre-Chorus]
And it goes something like (Woo-oooh)
I'm victorious (Woo-oooh)
It's my time (Woo-oooh)
There's no stopping this
'Cause I was born for this

[Chorus]
I do it for the glory
(Wo-oh-ooh-oh, woo-oh-oooh)
I do it for the glory
(Woo-ooh-oooh)

[Bridge]
When all is left is dust
They'll remember
Oh they'll remember us

[Chorus]
(Wo-oh-oh-ooh-oh, woo-ooh-ooh)
I do it for the...
(Wo-oh-oh-ooh-oh)
I do it for the glory
(Wo-oh-oh-ooh-oh, woo-oh-oooh)
I do it for the glory
(Wo-oh-oh-ooh-oh, woo-ooh-ooh)
I do it for the glory
(Wo-oh-oh-ooh-oh, woo-ooh-ooh)
I do it for the glory
(Woo-oh-oh-ooh-oh, woo-ooh-oh-ooh)
