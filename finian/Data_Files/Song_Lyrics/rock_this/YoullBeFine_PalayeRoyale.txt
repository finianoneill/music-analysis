[Verse 1]
I see it in those eyes
You're so damn hypnotized
You wanted to pretend the voice you hear is not in your head
You wanted to escape, but you're not that innocent
Just stay for the show, don't turn around
Cause mama say don't go

Oh no, no, no, no mama say don't go
No, no, no, no mama say don't go
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
(Hahahahaha!)

[Chorus]
I'm looking for you out there
I'm looking for truth inside your stare
I'm looking for you outside
Cause I mean it, no, I mean it, you'll be fine!
I'm looking for you this way
But you don't hear a word I say
Looking for you this time
Cause I mean it, yeah, I mean it, you'll be fine!

(You'll be fine)

[Verse 2]
Well, I can see the way she sleeps
Tonight, I find a better peace of mind
In her eyes, oh her eyes, oh her eyes, yeah
In her eyes, lord, her eyes, oh her eyes, yeah!

[Chorus]
I'm looking for you out there
I'm looking for truth inside your stare
I'm looking for you outside
Cause I mean it, no, I mean it, you'll be fine!
I'm looking for you this way
But you don't hear a word I say
I'm looking for you this time
Cause I mean it, yeah, I mean it, you'll be fine!

(Lalalalalalalala!) x2

[Spoken]
Have you ever felt so alone
You want to slip into the void
And never be seen again?
One day, that day is today

[Bridge]
I see it in those eyes
You are so damn hypnotized
You wanted to pretend the voice you hear is not in your head

[Chorus]
I'm looking for you out there
I'm looking for truth inside your stare
I'm looking for you outside
Cause I mean it, yeah, I mean it, you'll be fine!
I'm looking for you this way
But you don't hear a word I say
I'm looking for you this time
Cause I mean it, yeah, I mean it, you'll be fine!
