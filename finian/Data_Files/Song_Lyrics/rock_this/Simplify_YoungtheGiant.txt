[Verse 1]
Everything I say only seems to complicate it
Every other fight is just another night wasted
Are we gonna lose?
Is this gonna last?
Worry about the future, worry about the past
Think we're gonna break before I get a chance to say this

Don't wanna live without you

[Chorus]
Staring in your eyes, everything simplifies
Leave it all behind, everything simplifies
All we need is nothing more (when everything simplifies)
You and I need nothing more, everything simplifies

[Verse 2]
Stressing over this, stressing over that, we're falling
Like the whole world is banging on the door I'm calling
Are we gonna lose?
Is it gonna last?
Worry about the future, worry about the past
Filter out the noise, focus on my voice and fall in

[Chorus]
Staring in your eyes, everything simplifies
Leave it all behind, everything simplifies
All we need is nothing more (when everything simplifies)
You and I need nothing more, everything simplifies

[Bridge]
Why must we complicate
Every breath we take?
Why can't you see we'll be alright?

Nothing disappears
Even the pain we've been through
But all I need is here
Don't wanna live without you

[Chorus]
All we need is nothing more (when everything simplifies)
You and I need nothing more, everything simplifies
