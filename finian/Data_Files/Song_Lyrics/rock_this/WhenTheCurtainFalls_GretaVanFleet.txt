Well you’re so great and I love you so
You know I’m your biggest fan
I saw your picture and it’s the best
The finest in the land

Camera lights and action
And words you know so well
You’re in and out of fashion
In Hollywood of hell

When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow halls babe
Once a valley doll
Now you’re not at all
No

Well I love you in that movie show
Can I have your autograph
It’s so funny you have such charm
And whole thing made me laugh

Obetral and cocktails
You’re counting all your rings
They all said they loved you
(Didn’t they darlin’)
Well they’ve taken all your things

When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow halls babe
Once a valley doll
Now you’re not at all
No

Well listen darlin
It’s been real swell
What can I say
You’ve got it all
You’re a one woman show
But I’m not gonna’ lie
You could use a little work
Well at your age

What’ve you got baby

When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow halls babe
Once a valley doll
Now you’re not at all

Goodbye baby, goodbye
