[Verse 1]
Yeah, it’s over, it’s over, I’m circling these vultures
Got me praying, man, this hunger, and feeling something rotten
Last time I saw you, said “What’s up?” and pushed right through
Then I tried to catch you but we’re always on the move
And now it’s over, we’re sober, symptoms of the culture
And the night ain’t getting younger, last call’s around the corner
Feeling kinda tempted and I’m pouring out the truth
Just fading out these talkers ‘cause now all I want is you
Just sayin’

[Chorus]
Come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I’ll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me
And I’ll take you high

[Verse 2]
Well, I ain’t frontin' my intention, got your man outlined in chalk
It's a midnight intervention, got no plans to make it stop
Last time I saw you, said you wanna keep it light
But I’m here to tell you I’m not trying to change your mind
It’s alright, ooh, it’s alright, oooh

[Chorus]
Yeah, come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I’ll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me
And I’ll take you high

[Bridge]
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

[Chorus]
So come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I’ll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me

[Outro]
It's alright
