[Intro]
We are trying hard
Still found the walls in
Till there's nothing left at all
Karnaval

[Verse]
So tell me how this works
Our love's a love that hurts
I look upon you and all I see is me
They sell these battle scars
Weight on their heavy hearts
I look upon you and all I see is misery
So tell me how this works
Our love's a love that hurts
I look upon you and all I see is me
They sell these battle scars
Weight on their heavy hearts
I look upon you and all I see is me
Our love's a love that hurts, hurts, hurts

[Pre-Chorus]
Our love's a
Our love's a

[Chorus]
This is a love that hurts, yeah
Do you wanna tell the safe word?
This is a love that hurts, yeah
Do you wanna tell the safe word?
This is a love that hurts, yeah
Do you wanna tell the safe word?
This is a love that hurts, yeah
Do you wanna tell the safe word?

[Bridge]
Our love's a
Our love's a
Clap your hands, clap
Our love's a
Our love's a

[Chorus]
This is a love that hurts, yeah
Do you wanna tell the safe word?
This is a love that hurts, yeah
Do you wanna tell the safe word?
This is a love that hurts, yeah
Do you wanna tell the safe word?
This is a love that hurts, yeah
Do you wanna tell the safe word?
