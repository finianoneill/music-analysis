[Verse 1]
Make a move, don't wanna lose
Waiting to be closer to you
Looking like it's paradise
Baby, I got lost in your eyes
Baby, I just wanna tell you how I really feel
Yeah, I keep painting pictures in my head
That are just so real

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you got something different 'bout, no lie
I want him, baby, guess you better hold tight
Yeah, this could be the realest night of your life, your life

[Chorus]
When I get you alone
Come and pose for my camera phone
I don't wanna wait till the moment's gone
We get lost forever
Sit back and talk too much
'Bout all the good things I forgot
Twenty to the [?], but I'm smoking hot
We got lost forever
Look into the camera, babe

[Post-Chorus]
Closer baby, yeah, you know it baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Closer baby, yeah, you know it baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby

[Verse 2]
Can't let your pretty face slip away now
Now I got you closer than I ever dreamed of
Keep up with me, I don't wanna slow down
Baby, you shine even brighter with the flash off

[Pre-Chorus]
You got something different 'bout you, no lie
I want him, baby, guess you better hold tight
Yeah, this could be the realest night of your life, your life

[Chorus]
When I get you alone
Come and pose for my camera phone
I don't wanna wait till the moment's gone
We get lost forever (yeah, we got lost forever)
Sit back and talk too much
'Bout all the good things I forgot
Twenty to the [?], but I'm smoking hot
We got lost forever
Look into the camera, babe

[Post-Chorus]
Closer baby, yeah, you know it baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Closer baby, yeah, you know it baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby

[Bridge]
Don't wanna play it safe no more
And got me banging on your door
Don't wanna play it safe no more (yeah)
And got me banging on your door

[Chorus]
When I get you alone
Come and pose for my camera phone
I don't wanna wait till the moment's gone
We get lost forever
Sit back and talk too much
'Bout all the good things I forgot
Twenty to the [?], but I'm smoking hot
We got lost forever
Look into the camera, babe

[Outro]
Closer baby, yeah, you know it baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Closer baby, yeah, you know it baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
