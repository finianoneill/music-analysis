[Chorus]
What do you mean?
I gave you the key when the door wasn't open
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
See I gave you faith turned your doubt in to hoping
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping
What do you mean?
Since we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Oh oh oh
What do you mean?
Where are you now that I need ya?

[Verse 1]
You're so indecisive of what I'm saying
Trying to catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy, or complaining
Don't want for us to end where do I start
First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, wanna love all night
First you up and you're down and then between
I need you
I need you the most

[Chorus]
What do you mean?
Where are you now that i need you
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
Where are you now that I need ya?
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
Where are you now that I need ya
What do you mean
Since we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Where are you now that I need ya (Oh oh oh)
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

[Verse 2]
You're overprotective when I'm leaving
I'm trying to compromise but I can't win
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching
You had me from the start won't let this end
First you wanna go to the left
Then you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day
Wanna love all night

[Pre-Chorus]
First you up then you're down and you're between
I need you
I need you the most

[Chorus]
What do you mean?
Where are you now that I need ya?
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
Where are you now that I need ya?
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
Where are you now that I need ya
What do you mean
Since we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Where are you now that I need ya (Oh oh oh)
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

[Verse 3]
I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you the most
I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you the most
Where are you now that I need ya?
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no

[Chorus]
What do you mean?
Where are you now that I need ya?
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
Where are you now that I need ya
What do you mean
Since we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Where are you now that I need ya (Oh oh oh)
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
