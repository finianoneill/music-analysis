[Verse 1]
Where are You now
When darkness seems to win?
Where are You now
When the world is crumbling?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh I, I-I-I, I hear You say
I hear You say

[Chorus 1]
Look up child, ayy
Look up child, ayy

[Verse 2]
Where are You now (where are You?)
When all I feel is doubt?
Oh, where are You now
When I can't figure it out?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh I, I-I-I, I hear You say
I hear You say

[Chorus 2]
Look up child, ayy
Look up child, ayy
Look up child, ayy
Look up child, ayy
Look up…

[Bridge]
You're not threatened by the war
You're not shaken by the storm
I know You're in control
Even in our suffering
Even when it can't be seen
I know You're in control

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh I, I-I-I, I hear You say
I hear You say

[Chorus 3]
Look up child, ayy
Look up child, ayy
Look up child, oh-oh-oooh
I hear You say, You say, You say
Look up child, ayy
I hear You say, You say, You say (look up, look up, look up, look up)
Look up child, oh-ooh, ooh, oh-oooh…
I hear You say, You say, You say
Look up child, ayy
I hear You say, You say, You say (look up, look up, look up, look up)
Look up child
I hear You say, You say, You say
I hear You, I hear You calling my name, oh
Look up child, ayy
I hear You say, You say, You say (look up, look up)
Look up child, ayy
Look up child, ayy
Look up
