[Verse 1]
My mother used to stand beside the mirror
And she'd tell me what she hated
I don't like my eyes, my thighs, or how my front teeth
See, they're separated
And it seeped into me like the soil feeds the tree
Fatal as a poison
'Cause when you're twelve or thirteen
You don't know how to make your own choices

[Pre-Chorus]
If she thinks she's fat
I'm probably that
She thinks she's ugly
Surely I must be

[Chorus]
When am I ever gonna be good enough for anyone?
When am I ever gonna be good enough for anything?
They're all ten thousand steps ahead of me
Everything I'll never be
When am I ever gonna be good enough?

[Verse 2]
I'm the person at the party that keeps everybody laughing
Pour me a drink, try not to think
God knows I need a distraction
And by the end of the night and the very last bite
I'm swimming in the lonely 'cause no one really knows me
I'm afraid of them digging in deep, yeah
I'm afraid they won't like what they see

[Chorus]
When am I ever gonna be good enough for anyone?
When am I ever gonna be good enough for anything?
They're all ten thousand steps ahead of me
Everything I'll never be
When am I ever gonna be good enough?

[Bridge]
They think I'm one way, I'm not
I'm the opposite
They think I'm one way, I'm not
I'm the opposite

[Chorus]
When am I ever gonna be good enough for anyone?
When am I ever gonna be good enough for anything?
They're all ten thousand steps ahead of me
Everything I'll never be
When am I ever gonna be good enough?

[Outro]
Good enough, good enough, good enough
