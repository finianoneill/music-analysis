[Verse 1]
I'm played out, it's late out
I'm really hoping you don't care
This pent up momentum
He's starting to become aware

[Pre-Chorus]
I had the upper hand
But I don't, I don't
I know, I know, I don't
I had the upper hand
But I don't, I don't
I know, I know, I don't

[Chorus]
We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love
We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love

[Verse 2]
It's all there, it's not fair
Where will our hearts be when it's done?
When night falls, and you don't call
I'll stay up waiting for the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
I had the upper hand
But I don't, I don't
I know, I know, I don't
I had the upper hand
But I don't, I don't
I know, I know, I don't

[Chorus]
We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love
We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love

[Bridge]
I had the upper hand
But I, I, I
I had the upper hand
But I
O-oh

[Chorus]
We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love
We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love
