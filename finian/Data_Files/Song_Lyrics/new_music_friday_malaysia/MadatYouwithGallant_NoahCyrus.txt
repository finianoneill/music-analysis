[Verse 1]
Laying in your car when the lights go low
Dancing in the dark with you on my shoulder
And I don't even know what you came here for
All I know is I just want you closer

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, but it's all in my head
Yeah, I made a mess again
Yeah, I'm just the last one going out the door without you

[Chorus]
I take cold showers to remember I'm not with you
I leave with someone else to act like I don't miss you
I can't pretend I would give in
I hate myself for giving you the things I gave ya
When I know that it's over

[Verse 2]
I'm starting to hate how this all played out
'Cause you don't understand that I am trying
Maybe I'm a mess and God knows how
I'd do anything to justify it

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, but it's all in my head
Yeah, I made a mess again
Yeah, I'm just the last one seeing you for what I should be

[Chorus]
I take cold showers to remember I'm not with you
I leave with someone else to act like I don't miss you
I can't pretend I would give in
I hate myself for giving you the things I gave ya
When I know that it's over

[Chorus]
I take cold showers to remember I'm not with you
I leave with someone else to act like I don't miss you
I can't pretend I would give in
I hate myself for giving you the things I gave ya
When I know that it's over
