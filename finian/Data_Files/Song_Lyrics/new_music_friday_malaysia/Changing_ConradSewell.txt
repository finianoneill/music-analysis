[Verse 1]
I think I broke myself
Far beyond help
More than I'd ever admit
I know you blame it all back on yourself
Trying to bend just to fit
Oh, don't go changing just for me
Oh, don't go changing just for me

[Pre-Chorus)
'Cause whatever I said, whatever I did, you know I didn't mean
Oh, don't go changing just for me

[Chorus]
You don't have to speak just to break the silence
Don't have to cry just to make me weak
You don't have to stand when the walls are shaking
Don't have to lie just to make me believe
Oh, don't go changing just for me

[Verse 2]
I've ruined every chance I've ever had without ever skipping a beat
You're there to hold my hand time and again
Forgetting who you wanna be
Oh, don't go changing just for me
Oh, don't go changing just for me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause whatever I said, whatever I did  you know I didn't mean
Oh, don't go changing just for me

[Chorus]
You don't have to speak just to break the silence
Don't have to cry just to make me weak
You don't have to stand when the walls are shaking
Don't have to lie just to make me believe
You don't have to shout just to make listen
You don't have to hurt just to make me feel
You don't have to crash when my world is burning
Don't have to lie just to make me believe
Oh, don't go changing just for me

[Bridge]
You're the one that I lean on to guide me
You're the one I'd follow to the end
Never learn from my bad intentions
Need ya to make me a better man
Whatever I said, whatever I did, you know I didn't mean

[Chorus]
You don't have to speak just to break the silence
Don't have to cry just to make me weak
You don't have to stand when the walls are shaking
Don't have to lie just to make me believe
Oh, don't go changing just for me
Oh,  just don't change a single thing
