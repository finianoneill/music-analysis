[Intro]
Yeah, I been thinking a lot yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, come on

[Pre-Chorus]
Its been way too long
Since I looked you in your eyes
Riding round the town and staying out I don't wanna say goodbye
Everything is so different now
Your just what i'm missing now
Why I know that I can't have you back, I guess I'm tripping now

[Chorus]
Sometimes I start missing you crazy
Ain't nothing quite like you (yeah)
Love like this keeps going and going
I cannot forget you (no)
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh

[Verse 1]
Yeah yeah yeah
Ride around town in a hoopty (uh)
Way before I ever had a groupie (uh)
Back when I used to wear the same five shirts
Way before I ever had Gucci (uh)
Way before I ever had a rolex on
Talking back when I dropped [?] off
Picking up an eighth that my homie got
Fucking in the car thats the only spot
Back when I felt more free
Back when I smoked more weed
Back when I drove up and down 92 with a view of the moon and you in the passenger seat
That was so good
Now its all gone
It is what it is cause we both moved on
At least we
Have memories
And we also have this song (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Its been way too long
Since I looked you in your eyes
Riding round the town and staying out I don't wanna say goodbye
Everything is so different now
Your just what i'm missing now
Why I know that I can't have you back, I guess I'm tripping now

[Chorus]
Sometimes I start missing you crazy
Ain't nothing quite like you (yeah)
Love like this keeps going and going
I cannot forget you (no)
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh

[Verse 2]
Yeah, if you saw me now
Would you recognize me or would you call me out?
I know its been a while but I'm still me
But honestly its been so long that i wouldn't be offended if you didn't even feel me
Theres a gap now
Drinking enough to make us forget how we felt in the past now
Everything moving so fast now
Now, I miss things going slower
I miss us being closer
I mean I got a good thing but I feel like I don't even really know her
This a new life
I didn't do you right
But I got a second chance to prove my appreciation
I should take it
I'm sorry that I ever got jaded

[Pre-Chorus]
Its been way too long
Since I looked you in your eyes
Riding round the town and staying out I don't wanna say goodbye
Everything is so different now
Your just what i'm missing now
Why I know that I can't have you back, I guess I'm Tripping now

[Chorus]
Sometimes I start missing you crazy
Ain't nothing quite like you (yeah)
Love like this keeps going and going
I cannot forget you (no)
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh
