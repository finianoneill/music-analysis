[Verse 1]
What you been keeping to yourself
You always throw that shoe back on us
What you think you've been missing out
You always thought you had it figure out

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's just a flower and a shade there
You didn't see me when the rain came

[Chorus]
Won't you go hide it, you got something to feel
Won't you go hide it, you got something to feel
No telling me what's left for you (what's left for you)
Just stay here, I'll tell you all of the things I'd do
All of the things I'd do

[Verse 2]
Don't act like you ain't never know
And that you want to take it to show
Oh if you build in, thing will come
But where were you when I'll just have my fun

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I catch you hidden in the sunlight
I only needed you to think twice

[Chorus]
Won't you go hide it, you got something to feel
Won't you go hide it, you got something to feel
No telling me what's left for you (what's left for you)
Just stay here, I'll tell you all of the things I'd do

[Verse 3]
I got enough things, I'll make things right
I got enough smoke to last all night
I got enought things to get myself together
Although I know things, the thing ain't you
You gotta show me just what to do
The feeling in that move, baby you must be heaven
