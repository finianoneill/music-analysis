[Verse 1]
Here I go again
Three glasses in, counting my sins
Home alone again
It's three in the morning, just me and my demons at war again
So I'm calling in
Are you listening?

[Pre-Chorus]
You made a man this fragile
You made a heart that can break
You show me the road less traveled
Knowin' I'm gonna run away
You make me love so hard
When everything I love just leaves
Are you sure there's nothing wrong with me?

[Chorus]
And why does my life have to hurt so much?
Why can't I find any piece of love?
And why do I feel like I'm not enough?
Dear God, are you sure that you don't mess up?

[Verse 2]
Can we still call it praying if
All that I do is sitting here cursing
Cursing your name again
The truth is it's not even you
It's just me that I'm up against
But you made me this
Can we share the blame for this? Mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause after all you made a man this fragile
You made a heart that can break
I know you show me the road less traveled
Knowin' I'm gonna run away
You make me love so hard
When everything I love just leaves
Are you sure that there's nothing wrong with me?

[Chorus]
'Cause why does my life have to hurt so much?
Why can't I find any piece of love?
And why do I feel like I'm not enough?
Dear God, are you sure that you don't, that you don't mess up?
You don't mess up
I know you don't mess up
I know that you don't mess up

[Bridge]
I know this ain't for nothing
There's nothing you don't make
I know you got your reasons
This shit's just hard to take
I don't mean to criticize you
I know that I'm hard to teach
I know you tell me there's nothing wrong with me

[Chorus]
Yeah, but why does my life have to hurt so much?
And why can't I find any piece of love?
And why do I feel like I'm not enough?
Dear God, are you sure that you don't, that you don't mess up?
You don't mess up
I know you don't mess up, yeah
Dear God, just remind me you don't mess up
