(Boo boo boo-boo-boo-boo-boo)
(Boo boo boo-boo-boo-boo-boo)
(Boo boo boo-boo boo boo boo)

[Verse 1]
I've seen the Joshua Tree
Got down on my knees
Threw the Virgin Mother a prayer
I've walked glass barefooted
Strolled 'cross the devil's hot coal
I've tried everything, I swear

[Chorus]
Oh but hey, what can I say?
I'm a desperate man
I said hey, what can I say?
I'm just a desperate man

(Boo boo boo-boo-boo-boo-boo)
(Boo boo boo-boo-boo-boo-boo)
(Boo boo boo-boo boo boo boo)

[Verse 2]
Fortuneteller told me
"No more last chances
"You got no future at all"
Oh but I ain't listenin'
To black-hearted gypsy
And a crucifix through a bedroom wall

[Chorus]
Hey, what can I say?
I'm a desperate man
I said hey, what can I say?
I'm just a desperate man

(Boo boo boo-boo-boo-boo-boo)
(Boo boo boo-boo-boo-boo-boo)
(Boo boo boo-boo boo boo boo)
(Boo boo boo-boo-boo-boo-boo)
(Boo boo boo-boo-boo-boo-boo)
(Boo boo boo-boo boo boo boo)

[Bridge]
I'm a half-cock, full-tilt, scarred-hands-to-the-hilt
Don't-push-me grown-ass man
Yeah flashin' light caution, careful where ya cross son
'Til she comes back again

[Chorus]
Yeah hey, what can I say?
I'm a desperate man
Oh hey, what can I say?
I'm just a desperate man

[Outro]
Oh hey, I said hey
Woah, what can I say? I'm a desperate man
Oh hey, I said hey
I'm just a desperate man
(Boo boo boo-boo-boo-boo-boo)
(Boo boo boo-boo-boo-boo-boo)
(Boo boo boo-boo boo boo boo)
Grown-ass man
(Boo boo boo-boo-boo-boo-boo)
(Boo boo boo-boo-boo-boo-boo)
(Boo boo boo-boo boo boo boo)
(Boo boo boo-boo-boo-boo-boo)
(Boo boo boo-boo-boo-boo-boo)
(Boo boo boo-boo boo boo boo)
