[Verse 1]
Pour me, pour me another drink
'Cause I don't wanna feel a thing
No more, hell naw
I just want to sip 'til the pain wears off
Pour me, pour me another round
Line 'em up and knock 'em down
Two more let's go
'Cause I ain't ever hurt like this before

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna think about her
Wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
'Cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on

[Chorus]
I'm gonna need some whiskey glasses
Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'm gonna be single
I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
See the world through whiskey glasses

[Verse 2]
Last call
I swear this will be my last call
Now I ain't drunk dialing no more at 3am
Mr. Bartender hit me again

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna think about her
Wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
'Cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on

[Chorus]
I'm gonna need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'm gonna be single
I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
See the world through whiskey glasses

[Pre-Chours 2]
Line 'em up line 'em up line 'em up line 'em up
Knock 'em back knock 'em back knock 'em back knock 'em back
Fill 'em up fill 'em up fill 'em up fill 'em up
'Cause if she ain't ever coming back
Line 'em up line 'em up line 'em up line 'em up
Knock 'em back knock 'em back knock 'em back knock 'em back
Fill 'em up fill 'em up fill 'em up fill 'em up
'Cause if she ain't ever coming back

[Chorus]
I'm gonna need some whiskey glasses
Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'm need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'm gonna be single
I'm need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
See the world through whiskey glasses
