[Verse 1]
Like a rainy Sunday morning makes me want to stay in bed
Twisted up all day long
You're my inspiration, girl
You take me places, put the words right into these songs

[Bridge]
Stealing kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

[Chorus]
You make it easy loving up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my saving grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

[Verse 2]
You took all my rough around the edges
Never let it ruffle up your feathers, angel
Yeah I'm down for life, you got me wrapped around your finger
And I like it just in case you can't tell

[Chorus]
You make it easy loving up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my saving grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

[Bridge]
Stealing kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

[Chorus]
You make it easy loving up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my saving grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy
You make it easy
