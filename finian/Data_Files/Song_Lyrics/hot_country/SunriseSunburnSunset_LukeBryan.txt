[Verse 1]
Your daddy had a lakehouse
He had me paint it that summer sophomore year
Said I could stay for free
A couple buddies, a couple weeks
You rode in in a little red Honda
And headed straight for the pier
Tank top and cutoff jeans
A little PacSun underneath
Who knew it was 'bout to be

[Chorus]
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat, ayy

[Verse 2]
I turned those shutters the color of your eyes
'Til the day turned into night
And took turns with a jar
Turn that boat dock into a bar
And then we passed the guitar around the fire to each other
And watched all of our friends pair off with one another
But we felt like the stars we were under
And everybody knew that that was our summer

[Chorus]
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Yeah

[Bridge]
Whoa
We set July on fire
Whoa
Yeah, girl, you and I were
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat

[Chorus]
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Yeah

[Outro]
Whoa
We set July on fire
Whoa
Yeah, girl, you and I were
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
