(Back in your heart, back in your heart)
(Back in your heart, back in your heart)
(Back in your heart, back in your heart)
(And it's on)

Someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look
Oh baby give me one more chance
Won't you please let me (Back in your heart)
Oh darlin' I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms

Oh baby give me one more chance
Won't you please let me (Back in your heart)
Back in your heart, back in your heart
Back in your heart, back in your heart
Back in your heart, back in your heart
And it's on

Oh baby give me one more chance

Tryin' to live without your love
Is one long sleepless night
Let me show you girl
That I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on
I leave tearstains on the ground
Following the girl
I didn't even want around

Oh baby all I need is one more chance
Won't you please let me (Back in your heart)
Back in your heart, back in your heart
Back in your heart, back in your heart
Back in your heart, back in your heart
And it's on

Oh baby give me one more chance

When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look

Oh baby give me one more chance
Won't you please let me (Back in your heart)
Back in your heart, back in your heart
Back in your heart, back in your heart
Back in your heart, back in your heart
And it's on

(Back in your heart, back in your heart)
(Back in your heart, back in your heart)
(Back in your heart, back in your heart)
(Back in your heart)

Oh baby give me one more chance
Won't you please let me (Back in your heart)
