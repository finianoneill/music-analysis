[Verse 1: Mikey]
Spot a little hottie when I flipped out the shades
Lookin' like a red Rari sittin' in a driveway
Bottle of CÃ®roc with a hint of Kool-Aid
She done pulled up like I'm getting rid of weeds
Are you tired from running through my mind?
Take a break and we can have a good time
Show you moves like I'm the new James Brown
Me and you should get a room right now

[Pre-Chorus: Mikey]
'Cause if it's gold, I'll throw it away
You're worth more than every single chain
It ain't gon' work if you don't want it to
Best drink I take is when I'm sippin' you

[Chorus: Mikey]
You know where I go when we're dancing
Handshakes in The Hamptons and gettin' drunk in the mansions with you
And you look so classic, come through with that magic
You know that I'm 'bout to smash it, it's true

[Verse 2: Mikey]
I can take you to the room or I can take you to the beach
But we gotta leave at 9 'cause I gotta get my sleep
You can be that early bird, I'ma get that worm
Get with me, I'll take you 'round the world

[Pre-Chorus: Mikey]
'Cause if it's gold, I'll throw it away
You're worth more than every single chain
Walk with a limp, it just means I'm cool
Next trip I take, it's just me and you

[Chorus: Mikey]
You know where I go when we're dancing
Handshakes in The Hamptons and gettin' drunk in the mansions with you
And you look so classic, come through with that magic
You know that I'm 'bout to smash it, it's true

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Lil Boat
You said you lovin' up north when you comin' to the A
You said you need to find a crib, well, tell me where you wanna stay
I know we're not too pressed for time but can you pick up on the pace
I'm tired of looking at your pictures, wanna be up in your face
I wanna dance with you, I wanna laugh I wanna sing
Take you on the road, have you rockin' on my bling
Don't know if you're the one but if you are, you'll get a ring
That's later down the line, don't wanna rush these types of things
I'm a mama's boy so you gotta meet my mama first
As you whip the Coupe around, use the seat belt first
New shoes, new clothes and a Chanel purse
Vacaying in The Hamptons got a lazy curse

[Chorus: Mikey]
You know where I go when we're dancing
Handshakes in The Hamptons and gettin' drunk in the mansions with you
And you look so classic, come through with that magic
You know that I'm 'bout to smash it, it's true
