[Intro]
Survive ruins, was it my doing or fate
We made it through, we made it through, we made it through
Survive ruins, was it my doing or fate
Is this pre-scripted, or am I doing it great?
We made it through, we made it through, we made it through (Is this pre-scripted, or am I doing it great?)
We made it through

[Verse 1]
In the land of kings I'm your ace in the hole
Preoccupied with skin then you're vacant in soul
Young in a haste you running in place if you chasing foal
Son, when you earn value your worth and your paper will roll
Pro destiny 'til she profess to me, put her faith in the pole
Ain't a page of where the gauges all the ways I reload
Nothing sweet I couldn't eat from them unsavory rolls
Paid the price on my life to deciph now breaking the codes
Book assignments for crooked minors went straight to the prose
The symbol of grace in genuine place where fake is exposed
We made it, We made it, We made it, We made it, We made it, We made it, We made it, We made it

[Verse 2]
These figures is figurative I'm more literal
The dirt till I had a film every score original
Living livid I ain't pivot when it was pivotal
Since Nadel held a stable and shit it was most critical
How I'm unique is if I speak it I have visual
But careful because everything I say is admissible

[Hook]
Survive ruins, was it my doing or fate
We made it through, we made it through, we made it through
Survive ruins, was it my doing or fate
Is this pre-scripted, or am I doing it great?

[Verse 3]
Spent lectures that's infectious my strain harsh
Your tracks prove like fast food its the same farse
They all dipping on the road to riches so my lane sparse
Whole story self-incriminating here's the main parts
As far as opponents our darkest moments became hearts
Dealt blackjacks over 21 wasn't playing cards
From cold nights pray my low lives all die supreme
Plan to leap in can't be sleeping trying to find your dream
I'm industrial revolution for Ford they outta steam
Your hood probably good Friday my regime Halloween
To hold the curb show nerve never nervous
I swear these squares ain't our peers as Juries read the verdicts
Insight can light the dark path with a better purpose
Will join the task with my boy and them pass lead the service
Day you ever display your treasure they at your chest
Marks are falling we all in balling they praying for next

[Hook]
Survive ruins, was it my doing or fate
We made it through, we made it through, we made it through
Survive ruins, was it my doing or fate
Is this pre-scripted, or am I doing it great?
We made it through, we made it through, we made it through
We made it through, we made it through, we made it through
We made it through, we made it through, we made it through
