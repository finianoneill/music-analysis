[Verse 1]
I got something to say
Baby, you won't like it
But I know you've been thinking 'bout it too
Tell me, why did you hide
All of your emotions?
But deep inside I always knew, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know, I don't know
Why you always make me feel like a failure?
I don't know, no, I don't know why it's my fault?
But I know, yeah I know, yeah I know
That what I'm about to say
You won't like it, yeah
No, you won't like it

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, I'm in love with how you say goodbye
Now, I now, I know who you are
All we did was just a waste of time
Now, I now, I know who you are

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, eh-na-na-na, eh-na-na-na, oy-oy-oy
Now, I now, I know who you are
Ooh, eh-na-na-na, eh-na-na-na, oy-oy-oy
Now, I now, I know who you are

[Verse 2]
You don't need to pretend
Sayin' that you love me
When you don't even feel a single thing, yeah
I don't wanna be friends
I wanna run away from us too
It's gonna be easy when we do, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know, I don't know
Why you always make me feel like a failure?
I don't know, no, I don't know why it's my fault?
But I know, yeah I know, yeah I know
That what I'm about to say
You won't like it, yeah
No, you won't like it

[Bridge]
Now I know, now I know, now I know
That I can make my own way
Now I know, now I know, now I know
That we didn't make any sense anyway

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, I'm in love with how you say goodbye
Now, I now, I know who you are
All we did was just a waste of time
Now, I now, I know who you are

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, eh-na-na-na, eh-na-na-na, oy-oy-oy
Now, I now, I know who you are
Ooh, eh-na-na-na, eh-na-na-na, oy-oy-oy
Now, I now, I know who you are
