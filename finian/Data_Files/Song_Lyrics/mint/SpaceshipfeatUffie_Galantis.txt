[Verse]
Hey, I found a spaceship
You got the kinda love that's taking me new places
Hey, I'm on a spaceship
You got the kinda love that's taking me new places
Hey, I found a spaceship
You got the kinda love that's taking me new places
Hey, I'm on a spaceship
You got the kinda love that's taking me new places
Hey, I found a spaceship
Hey, you take me high-igh-igh
Three, two, one

[Chorus]
Hey, I found a spaceship
You got the kinda love that's taking me new places
Hey, I'm on a spaceship
You got the kinda love that's taking me new places
Take me high, get me lost in the night
Take me high, take me high, get me lost
You take me high-igh-igh
Hey, I found a spaceship
You got the kinda love that's taking me new places

[Post-Chorus]
Spaceship

[Verse]
Hey, I found a spaceship
You got the kinda love that's taking me new places
Hey, I'm on a spaceship
You got the kinda love that's taking me new places
Hey, you take me high-igh-igh
Three, two, one

[Chorus]
Hey, I found a spaceship
You got the kinda love that's taking me new places
Hey, I'm on a spaceship
You got the kinda love that's taking me new places
Take me high, get me lost in the night
Take me high, take me high, get me lost
You take me high-igh-igh
Hey, I found a spaceship
You got the kinda love that's taking me new places

[Outro]
Hey, I found a spaceship
Hey, I found a spaceship
You got the kinda love that's taking me new places
