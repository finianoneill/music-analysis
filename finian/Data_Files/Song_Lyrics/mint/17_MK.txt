[Chorus]
You ain't even missing me baby
So why do I want you so badly?
Making a fool of me, I'm so keen
Baby, I got your back, like we're still seventeen

I'm gonna fight for you, you know where I'll be
Baby, I got your back, like we're still seventeen
I'm gonna ride for you, honey, I'm so keen
Baby, I got your back, like we're still seventeen

You ain't even missing me baby
So why do I want you so badly?
Making a fool of me, I'm so keen
Baby, I got your back, like we're still seventeen

I'm gonna fight for you, you know where I'll be
Baby, I got your back, like we're still seventeen
I'm gonna ride for you, honey, I'm so keen
Baby, I got your back, like we're still seventeen

You ain't even missing me baby
So why do I want you so badly?
Making a fool of me, I'm so keen
Baby, I got your back, like we're still seventeen

I'm gonna fight for you, you know where I'll be
Baby, I got your back, like we're still seventeen
I'm gonna ride for you, honey, I'm so keen
Baby, I got your back, like we're still seventeen

You ain't even missing me baby
So why do I want you so badly?
Making a fool of me, I'm so keen
Baby, I got your back, like we're still seventeen

I'm gonna fight for you, you know where I'll be
Baby, I got your back, like we're still seventeen
I'm gonna ride for you, honey, I'm so keen
Baby, I got your back, like we're still seventeen
