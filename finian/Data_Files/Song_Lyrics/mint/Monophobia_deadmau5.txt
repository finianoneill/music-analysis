[Verse 1]
Killed the demons of my mind
Ever since you came around
We're a river, running wild
How could I have been so blind?

[Pre-Chorus]
I just live a fast life
Forget about the past time
I numb out to escape my feels
And friendships only pass by
Show up, gone, like strobe lights
But with you, I feel something real

[Chorus]
And I'd walk a million miles, just to see your smile
Till the day I die
Oh, I need you by my side, we get high on life
Till the day we die
High on life till the day we die
High on life till the day we die
High on life till the day we die
And I'd walk a million miles, just to see your smile
Till the day I die

[Post-Chorus]
High on life till the day we die

[Verse 2]
Through my fingers, out of sight
How could I have let you go?
Cutting corners, turning stones
But I can only see your ghost

[Pre-Chorus]
I just live a fast life
Forget about the past time
I numb out to escape my feels
And friendships only pass by
Show up, gone, like strobe lights
But with you, I feel something real

[Chorus]
And I'd walk a million miles, just to see your smile
Till the day I die
Oh, I need you by my side, we get high on life
Till the day we die

[Post Chorus]
High on life till the day we die
Oh, I need you by my side, we get high on life
Till the day we die
High on life till the day we die

[Outro]
And I'd walk a million miles, just to see your smile
Till the day I die
Oh, I need you by my side, we get high on life
Till the day we die
