# Recipe to the perfect song
##Exploration of song popularity on Spotify

* Use the Spotify API to query for songs in 'Top Lists' playlist category using [/elize-papineau/nltk_lyric-sentiment_scores.ipynb](https://github.com/finianoneill/music-analysis/blob/master/elize-papineau/nltk_lyric-sentiment_scores.ipynb)
* Get song lyrics using Genius API using [/finian/Notebooks/Genius_API_Get-tracks-and-lyrics.ipynb](https://github.com/finianoneill/music-analysis/blob/master/finian/Notebooks/Genius_API_Get-tracks-and-lyrics.ipynb)

* Using [/finian/Notebooks/Streaming_Rates_for_Music_with_Lyrics_versus_Music_without_Lyrics.ipynb](https://github.com/finianoneill/music-analysis/blob/master/finian/Notebooks/Streaming_Rates_for_Music_with_Lyrics_versus_Music_without_Lyrics.ipynb) and [/elize-papineau/nltk_lyric-sentiment_scores.ipynb](https://github.com/finianoneill/music-analysis/blob/master/elize-papineau/nltk_lyric-sentiment_scores.ipynb), we attempted to address the following questions:
..*Does “instrumentalness” affect song popularity?
..*Does genre affect song popularity?
..*Are positive or negative songs more popular?
..*Within the top spotify playlists, which words/phrases are used most frequently?
