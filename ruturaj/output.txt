[Chorus]
I got what you need every season
Giving you the keys, you can keep 'em
Got me in your seat, pull me deeper
And every time we hit I'm addic-, I'm addicted
Rolling in your trees, I'ma feen out
Seeing everything I could dream 'bout
And no one's gonna bring what I need now
I'm waiting for the heat, don't you hold-, don't you hold out

[Verse 1]
Ooh you bring me out, you turn me to a heathen babe
Can't fake it now I'm calling for you daily
So take this crown, I'll be the throne
And put it down every type of way, yeah

[Chorus]
I got what you need every season
Giving you the keys, you can keep 'em (keep em)
Got me in your seat, pull me deeper (deeper)
And every time we hit I'm addic-, I'm addicted
Rolling in your trees, I'ma feen out (Ohh)
Seeing everything I could dream 'bout (dream bout)
And no one's gonna bring what I need now (I need no)
I'm waiting for the heat, don't you hold-, don't you hold out

[Verse 2]
Don't ask no questions
Lemme do my thing in your blessings
Blow each other mind so dizzy
We be on that Dwayne and Whitley
Always chilling 'cause I know you got me covered yeah
There ain't distance ever of this world we're living in
No more thinking straight and no more holding out
Feel ya all around me, our own space and time (time)
So take this crown (yeah), I'll be the throne
And put it down every type of way, yeah

[Chorus]
I know what you need every season
Giving you the keys, you can keep 'em (keep em)
Got me in your seat, pull me deeper (deeper)
And every time we hit I'm addic-, I'm addicted
Rolling in your trees, I'ma feen out
Seeing everything I could dream 'bout (dream bout)
And no one's gonna bring what I need now (I need no)
I'm waiting for the heat, don't you hold-, don't you hold out

[Bridge]
I'm addicted to what you do (oh what you do)
Need another hit, needing you (I need it, ah ha ha haa)
You

[Interlude]



[Intro: Static Major]
Haha, haha
Yeah, ayy (after dark)

[Chorus: Drake, Static Major & Both]
In a whip so low
No one's gotta know (after dark)
Knockin' at your door
I don't gotta work anymore (after dark)
You can
Put your phone down, you're gonna need two hands (after dark)
You can't get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark

[Verse 1: Drake & Static Major]
Late night like Left Eye, I'm creepin'
Assuming the worst 'cause I haven't heard from you all weekend
Your silence is drivin' me up the wall, up the wall
I cannot tell if you're duckin' calls or missin' calls
'Cause you've been so patient
I drink on the job and smoke on the job
So, I don't know how serious you take it
Can't offer much more, you've heard it before
That narrative for me isn't changin'
I wanna make you a priority
I wanna let you know there's more to me
I wanna have your faith restored in me
I'll be on my way (after dark)

[Chorus: Drake, Static Major, Ty Dolla $ign, Drake & Static]
In a whip so low, no one's gotta know
(No one's gotta know) after dark
Knockin' at your door, I don’t gotta work anymore
(I don't gotta work no more) after dark
You can, put your phone down, you’re gonna need two hands
(Ooh yeah, ooh yeah) after dark
You can't get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Late night, me and you, got you wet like the pool
Then I'm tryna dive in, put some time in, yeah
Get the vibe right, get your mind right
It's gon' be a long night (ooh yeah)
Put your feet in this water, don't wanna get your hair wet
We've hooked up a couple times, we ain't took it there yet
You broke up with your man and ain't been with nobody else
You like, "Fuck these niggas," rather keep it to yourself
He did you wrong, he left you down bad
Now you can't trust nobody
You said, "Do anything, but just don't lie to me"
I said I ride for you, girl, you said you ride for me
Umm, pulled up to the show than we got ghost
And when it's after dark anything goes

[Chorus: Drake, Static Major, Ty Dolla $ign, Drake & Static]
In a whip so low, no one's gotta know
(No one's gotta know) after dark
Knockin' at your door, I don’t gotta work anymore
(I don't gotta work no more) after dark
You can, put your phone down, you’re gonna need two hands
(Ooh yeah, ooh yeah) after dark
You can't get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark
