[Verse 1]
I like it, like it
You got a way
I like the way you drop
You dropping on me
Don't ever say let's get it poppin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, when you walk right into the room
Everything gon' stop
Try so hard to be cool but I know I'm not

[Chorus]
Baby, I wanna know
Baby, I wanna know
How you make it look easy
Baby, I wanna go
From your head to your toe
I'ma make it look easy
Easy, easy

[Verse 2]
Girl, what's your tempo?
I'll keep it there
Give anything you want
No competition, it ain't a race
No, we don't have to rush

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, when you walk right into the room
Everything gon' stop
Baby, I can't wait no more but I will if you want

[Chorus]
Baby, I wanna know
Baby, I wanna know
How you make it look easy
Baby, I wanna go
From your head to your toe
I'ma make it look easy
Easy, easy
Easy, easy

[Outro]
Baby, when you walk right into the room
Everything gon' stop
I can't wait anymore but I will if you want
