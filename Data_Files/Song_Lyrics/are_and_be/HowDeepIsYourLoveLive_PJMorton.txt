[PJ:]
Here we go 2, 3, ah
Yeah, yeah

Heee hee hee

[Verse 1: PJ]
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again

[Pre-Chorus:]
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show

[Chorus: PJ & YEBBA]
How deep is your love?
Is your love
How deep is your love
I really need to learn
Cause we're living in a world of fools, yeah
Breakin’ us down, yeah
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

[Verse 2: YEBBA]
I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour yeah, yeah, yeah
You're my savior when I fall

[Pre-Chorus: YEBBA]
And you may not think I care for you
When you know deep down inside
I really do
And it's me you need to show

[Chorus x3:  PJ & YEBBA]
How deep is your love?
Is your love
How deep is your love
I really need to learn
Cause we're living in a world of fools, oh-oh
Breakin’ us down, yeah
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

[PJ:]
Break the music come on say it

[Chorus:]
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love
I really need to learn
Cause we're living in a world of fools, oh-oh
Breakin’ us down, yeah
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

[PJ:]
Cmon let's say it one more time y'all help us

[Outro:]
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love
I really need to learn
Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breakin’ us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
