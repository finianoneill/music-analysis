[Verse 1]
Tell me because I've said it all
I've got a feeling we must've hit a wall here
And baby boy, please tell me like it is
'Cause you talk love but you never act on it

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the drive it is alive and honey, it is calling you
And I'm numb, you're tryna hide it, baby, I need more from you
So could you please respond to me because I'll never understand
I give you the keys and while you gladly take 'em you, don't use them

[Chorus]
You tell me all the time, baby
I'm the light in your life
And you love me more each day
You are starting to drive me crazy
Why won't you realise you gotta love me right, baby

[Post-Chorus]
Oh yeah
(All night, come love me right)

[Verse 2]
Help me I feel I've lost myself
It's just this one thing, we're great everywhere else
Or is it just me? Am I not what you want?
'Cause if that's the case baby, why lead me on?

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the drive it is alive and honey, it is calling you
And I'm numb, you're tryna hide it, baby, I need more from you
So could you please respond to me because I'll never understand
I give you the keys and while you gladly take 'em you, don't use them

[Chorus]
(Why won’t you)
You tell me all the time, baby (babe)
I'm the light in your life
And you love me more each day
You are starting to drive me crazy (say, ya)
Why won't you realise you gotta love me right, baby (why won’t)
You tell me all the time, baby
(Come on, you’re in the zone, I need you here right next to me)
I'm the light in your life
And you love me more each day
(Come on, get off your phone, I need to feel your body)
You are starting to drive me crazy
Why won't you realise you gotta love me right, baby
You tell me all the time, baby
I'm the light in your life
And you love me more each day
You are starting to drive me crazy
Why won't you realise you gotta love me

[Bridge]
Ohh, that I’m the light in your life
And you love me more each day (Come on now, baby)
Why won’t you realize (You got to, you got to, my baby)
You gotta love me right, baby

You tell me all the time, baby (Love on me, love on me, you love me)
(I want your love on me, love on me, you love me)
I’m the light in your life
(Love on me, love on me, you love me)
And you love me more each day
You are starting to drive me crazy
Why won't you realise you gotta love, right right right

You tell me all the time, baby
I’m the light in your life
And you love me more each day
You’re starting to drive me crazy
Why won’t you realize

[Outro]
Ohh, love
Love me
Love me right
