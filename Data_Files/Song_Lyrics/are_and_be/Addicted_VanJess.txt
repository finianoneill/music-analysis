[Chorus]
I got what you need every season
Giving you the keys, you can keep 'em
Got me in your seat, pull me deeper
And every time we hit I'm addic-, I'm addicted
Rolling in your trees, I'ma feen out
Seeing everything I could dream 'bout
And no one's gonna bring what I need now
I'm waiting for the heat, don't you hold-, don't you hold out

[Verse 1]
Ooh you bring me out, you turn me to a heathen babe
Can't fake it now I'm calling for you daily
So take this crown, I'll be the throne
And put it down every type of way, yeah

[Chorus]
I got what you need every season
Giving you the keys, you can keep 'em (keep em)
Got me in your seat, pull me deeper (deeper)
And every time we hit I'm addic-, I'm addicted
Rolling in your trees, I'ma feen out (Ohh)
Seeing everything I could dream 'bout (dream bout)
And no one's gonna bring what I need now (I need no)
I'm waiting for the heat, don't you hold-, don't you hold out

[Verse 2]
Don't ask no questions
Lemme do my thing in your blessings
Blow each other mind so dizzy
We be on that Dwayne and Whitley
Always chilling 'cause I know you got me covered yeah
There ain't distance ever of this world we're living in
No more thinking straight and no more holding out
Feel ya all around me, our own space and time (time)
So take this crown (yeah), I'll be the throne
And put it down every type of way, yeah

[Chorus]
I know what you need every season
Giving you the keys, you can keep 'em (keep em)
Got me in your seat, pull me deeper (deeper)
And every time we hit I'm addic-, I'm addicted
Rolling in your trees, I'ma feen out
Seeing everything I could dream 'bout (dream bout)
And no one's gonna bring what I need now (I need no)
I'm waiting for the heat, don't you hold-, don't you hold out

[Bridge]
I'm addicted to what you do (oh what you do)
Need another hit, needing you (I need it, ah ha ha haa)
You

[Interlude]
