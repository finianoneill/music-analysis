[Verse 1]
Razor blade a heart string
Who you tryna fix now?
Broken record left on repeat
Another buildup to the let down, the let down
Steady speedin' to a new pain
Tragic collision on the 110
And I wish that you would slow down
'Cause maybe then you'd see it comin'
I'm sayin'

[Chorus]
Have you, you ever (Have you ever, ever)
Ever fucked with a real nigga (yeah)
Real ass nigga before?
I know you're so tired of
Feeling like you deserve better
You need a real ass nigga like me, yeah
Like me, baby
Oh, right now
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Empty chargers, pages torn
Hanging on to every word
Tequila shots to balance all the sweetest lies that I can burn
How long were you waiting?
Will you take me 'fore you give up
Rules are meant to break in here
Hearts are meant to break in love
(You) way too smart for this
(You) but your problem is
(You) you don't know badder, babe
(You) it's so much better, babe
(You) runnin' to the darkness, but you lookin' for the light
Searchin' through the city for what's been here all this time

[Chorus]
Babe, I love you
You are fire
(Have you ever done and done and done)
Ever fuck with a real nigga
A real ass nigga before?
You wasted time searchin'
But we both know that you deserve better
You need a real ass nigga like me, yeah
Love me, baby
Oh, babe

[Bridge]
Respect you too much not to be one hundred with you
You deserve the world and me running with you
You know we always been connected
I ain't perfect
Baby, you should always feel protected
I'm saying

[Chorus]
Have you, have you ever
Ever had a real man, baby?
Even had a real man like me?
And I know you
Know you searchin', baby
You know you deserve, you deserve better
You deserve better, ooh

[Outro]
(Have you, you ever) Ooh
(Ever fuck with a real nigga)
Gotta keep it one hundred with you, oh yeah
(A real ass nigga before)
With someone like me
(I know you keep searchin')
('Cause you know that you deserve better)
(Need a real ass nigga like me, yeah)
For real, though
