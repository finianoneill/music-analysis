[Verse 1: TK Kravitz]
I put hearts under your pictures
Just to let them niggas know I’m still here (let 'em know)
We been broke up for awhile so some time
I don’t know how to feel (let 'em know)
I see you got a new nigga
But that nigga ain’t me (no)
I know that pussy worth a million
Don’t give it for free (cha ching)
You looking at me like don’t say that (why?)
But I gotta keep it real
We go way back (for real)
Why play games when we grown?
You see me textin' your phone
I’m not used to being alone
I guess I gotta figure this shit out
He said “he yours”
Tell that nigga “watch his mouth” (for real)

[Chorus: TK Kravitz]
I don’t play about you (I don’t)
I don’t play about you
I don’t play about you (I don’t)
I don’t play about you (whoa)
I feel like you my property
I feel like you my property (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I feel like you my property (let 'em know)
I feel like you my property (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Keke Palmer]
I put hearts under your picture
Just to let them bitches know that I’m still here
Yeah I know that we broke up over nothing
Let it go, that was last year (last year)
Checking on me, think you know something
No more telling stories 'cause you in your feelings
Lookin' at you like "why you say that?"
'Cause when I saw you with her
You ain't say shit

[Chorus: TK Kravitz]
I don't play about you (I don't)
I don't play about you
I don’t play about you (I don’t)
I don’t play about you (whoa)
I feel like you my property
I feel like you my property (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I feel like you my property (let 'em know)
I feel like you my property (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge: TK Kravitz]
Don’t take it wrong
Don’t take it wrong
This is where you ‘posed to be
Where you ‘posed to be
Don’t take it wrong
Don’t take it wrong
But this is where you ‘posed to be
Where you ‘posed to be
I know I fucked up
I know I fucked up
But this is where you ‘posed to be
Where you ‘posed to be
I know I fucked up
I know I fucked up
But this is where you ‘posed to be (let em know)

[Chorus: TK Kravitz]
See I don’t play about you (I don’t)
I don’t play about you
I don’t play about you (I don’t)
I don’t play about you
I feel like you my property
I feel like you my property (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I feel like you my property (let 'em know)
I feel like you my property (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro: TK Kravitz]
