[Intro: Aretha Franklin]
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment... that it's too soon to...

[Verse 1:]
You
You wanna lay up all the time
And I don't mind
But I need my feet uncompromised
And I've been by your side
But I need space right now
Got my mind on my money
Gotta hustle 'cause it's go time

[Pre-Chorus:]
I just gotta do me
Me
Yeah, that's all I need, I got to be free
Baby, we both know...

[Chorus - Aretha Franklin & DaniLeigh]
I know I can't afford to stop
(All I know)
I know I can't afford to stop
(I just can't afford to stop)
I know I can't afford to stop
(Long as you know)
(All I know)
I know I can't afford to stop

[Verse 2:]
I, I got ambitions, can't deny
That you treat me right
You gotta understand my pride
Won't let me settle down, I just can't right now
If you're around when I come back around
Then we might vibe

[Pre-Chorus:]
I just gotta do me
Me
Yeah, that's all I need, I got to be free
Baby, we both know...

[Chorus - Aretha Franklin & DaniLeigh]
I know I can't afford to stop
(All I know)
I know I can't afford to stop
(I just can't afford to stop)
I know I can't afford to stop
(Long as you know)
(All I know)
I know I can't afford to stop

[Bridge: Kes & DaniLeigh]
Baby, can you stay around, stay around, stay around?
Baby, I just can't right now, can't right now, can't right now
Baby girl, I need you now, need you now, need you now
Gotta get this paper, paper, I'ma have to chase it down
Baby, we both know...

[Chorus - Aretha Franklin & DaniLeigh]
I know I can't afford to stop
(All I know)
I know I can't afford to stop
(I just can't afford to stop)
I know I can't afford to stop
(Long as you know)
(All I know)
I know I can't afford to stop

I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment... that it's too soon...
