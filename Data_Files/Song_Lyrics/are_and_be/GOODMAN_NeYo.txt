[Intro]
Hey DJ
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
I just wanna be a good man, good man to you, girl
That's all I want babe, ay
That's all I want to be, baby
That's all I want to be, baby
So I just wanna be a good man, good man to you, girl
That's all I want babe, baby
That's all I want to be, baby
That's all I want to be, babe

[Vesre 1]
So I just wanna pick the phone up
Every single time you call
Then no matter where I'm in
I wanna be chillin with Obama talkin' business and see you callin' and tell him, "Hold up I gotta take this"
Let the world wait
Wanna wear it like a medal
Tell 'em I'm a spoken for a fellow
Ladies say, "Hello" like I'm who they want to be with
I do everything with my left, I know you'll see it trifiling
And baby I ain't nowhere perfect
But I promise to promise to make it all worth it
Giving you the things to be the man you deserved it
Make you show you're smiling, way more than your hurtin'
Taking my time when you're talkin'
Remindin' you how bad you are
Often keep 'em legs shakin' making sure you understand
That it's in my plan

[Chorus]
Said I just wanna be a good man, good man to you, girl
That's all I want to be, baby
That's all I want to be, baby
That's all I want to be
So I just wanna be a good man, good man to you, girl
That's all I want babe
That's all I want to be, baby
That's all I want to be, oh

[Verse 2]
Tell the truth, tell the whole damn truth
Never gonna leave the parts I'm gon' upset you
Never doin' things I ain't got no business doin'
When you round, when you not around
I respect you and I would never make a fool out you baby (no, no)
No, I will never make a fool out you baby (no, no)
I'm making sure you can trust me beyond a shadow of a doubt
When the broads run up on you, with my name up on the mountain
Tell 'em you can become with all that
Cause you know what we got is beyond all that
You know we got that real thing (real thing)
Don't be the object of some hatin', hatin'
But we gon' be alright, we gon' be alright
Making love after every fight
Girl from the day I put the ring up on your hands
In front of friends and fans

[Chorus]
I had a plan and the plan is to be a good man, good man to you, girl
That's all I want to be, babe
That's all I want to be, baby
That's all I want to be
Say that wanna be a good man, good man to you, girl
That's all I want to be
That's all I want to be, baby
All I want to be, oh

[Outro]
I wanna be a good man to you baby
