[Verse 1]
Why make me wait for so long
So long
I don't like being in the dark
No, I don't
Half the time, it's like you ain't there
Where you at?
Stop acting like you care
You know, I won't

[Chorus]
My money long
This Moncler coat feels nice
Who even knows your name?
No one, know you want
You trippin' balls
I'm a superstar
Play your part
I could have you whippin' hard
Don't push your luck, girl
Get lost
Gave you all I had
But it wasn't enough
Thought I wasn't much
But now you wanna make love
Now you wanna make love to me
Thought I wasn't much
But now you wanna make love to me
But now you wanna make love
Now you wanna make love to me
Thought I wasn't much
Now you wanna make love to me

[Verse 2]
I took all I could take for so long
So long
Happened to me, you were wrong
Yeah, you are
Cry me a river
You left me, stay with him
Live with your decision, no
Darling, Lord knows I done gave you up
Know, I won't

[Chorus]
My money long
This Moncler coat feels nice
Who even knows your name?
Know, I won't
No, you won't
You trippin' balls
I'm a superstar
Try to call now, it just might break your heart
Don't push your luck, girl
Get lost
Gave you all I had
But it wasn't enough
Thought I wasn't much
But now you wanna make love
Now you wanna make love to me
Thought I wasn't much
But now you wanna make love to me
Girl, you wanna make love
Now you wanna make love to me
Thought I wasn't much
Now you wanna make love to me
Now you wanna make love
Now you wanna make love to me
Thought I wasn't much
But now you wanna make love to me
Now you wanna make love
Now you wanna make love to me
Thought I wasn't much
Now you wanna make love to me
