[Verse 1]
If I want you, be my lady
I'm gon' call you lady lady, lady lady
If I think you'd be my baby
I'm gon' shoot my shot and call you lady lady, lady lady

[Pre-Chorus]
If you classy but you're reckless
Then you gon' get choose a necklace lady lady

[Chorus]
She got me wondering if I
Should make her my baby, lady lady
Maybe I should say the things I type online
In real life

[Verse 2]
Happy to call you my lady, you're special
Happy that you're my baby
Happy to call you my lady, you're special
Happy that you're my baby

[Outro]
If you classy but you're reckless
Then you gon' get choose a necklace lady lady
If you classy but you're reckless
Then you gon' get choose a necklace lady lady
