(Verse 1)
Reboosts and quiet nights
With tales and butterflies
Catching moments with you
Playing house until itâ€™s true

(Bridge)
Well, I was wondering
If you could see
All that we could be
It's something that's so true

(Hook)
You make me wanna (ha ha ha ha)
And I gotta tell ya (ha ha ha ha)
And I gotta tell you, that you make me wanna
You make me wanna
(Sweet)

(Verse 2)
Fireworks from a cloud
Only you in the crowd
Set the table just for two (just for us two)
Time wasted, not with you

(Bridge)
Well, I was wondering
If you could see
All that we could be
It's something that's so true

(Hook)
You make me wanna (ha ha ha ha)
And I gotta tell ya (ha ha ha ha)
And I gotta tell you, that you make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna (ha ha ha ha)
I gotta tell ya (ha ha ha ha)
You make me wanna (ha ha ha ha)
I gotta tell ya (ha ha ha ha)
