[Verse 1]
Early in the morning
She's running through my mind again
Girl, you got me wondering
If we should be more than friends

[Hook]
Do you wanna be
Do you wanna be
Do you wanna be
Don't you wanna be
Would you wanna be my girl? (Girl)
(Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl)
My girl, girl
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Every single evening
She's telling me about her day
My feelings get to creeping
I wonder if she feels the same

[Hook]
Does she wanna be
Does she wanna be
Does she wanna be
I think she wanna be my girl
My girl, oh (girl)
Damn

[Bridge]
I don't know
Pretty sure though
Damn
It's like
I think she wants to be (Girl, girl, girl, girl)
At least I hope she does, shit
Girl, yea, ooh oh
Ta-da yeah, ooh ooh ta-da, ta-da hey

[Hook]
I think she wanna be
I think she wanna be
I think she wanna be
I think she wanna be my girl (Girl, girl, girl)
My girl

[Outro]
Girl (girl)
Girl (girl)
Girl (girl)
