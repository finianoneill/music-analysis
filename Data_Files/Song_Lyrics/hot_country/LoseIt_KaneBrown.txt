[Intro]
Yeah...

[Verse 1]
That lit up ringing buzzing good for nothing phone in your hands
The directions to the party that's just started with that cover band
That old school radio station, let's just drive until it's faded
Girl, let's lose it, tonight

'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flipping your hair, baby, I swear

[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat tonight
Close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancing, swaying to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Verse 2]
Let's start with them Luccheses, baby, kick 'em to the floorboard
And bobby pins holding your hair up, girl, you don't need 'em no more
That dress hanging off your shoulder as you move a little closer
Yeah, let's lose it tonight, yeah girl

[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat tonight
Close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancing, swaying to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Bridge]
'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flipping your hair, baby I swear

[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat tonight
Close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancing, swaying to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Outro]
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
