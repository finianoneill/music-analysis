Some people don't know when to quit and that's why they quit
Some need to hit the bottom to see they got a problem, they can't handle it
But that ain't why I started cleaning up my life
Wish it was but, ooh, that would be a lie

I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you girl, no, no, no
Baby can you come over
I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah
Girl, every time you do
I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love
I've been sober since you broke my heart in two
'Cause drunk me can't get over you (there ain't no hangover like you)
Can't get over, can't get over (there ain't no hangover like you)
Oh, no, no, no

All those bottles sitting up on the shelf are just salt on the wound
One sip and I'm picking up the phone trying not to go home without you
And that ain't nothing but a whole lotta pain
And that kind of hurt, ooh hurts, it ain't worth another drink

I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, no, no, no
Baby, can you come over
I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah
Girl, every time you do I just end up
Head all messed up like the sheets where we made love
I've been sober since you broke my heart in two
'Cause drunk me can't get over you, no
Can't get over you, oh, no, no, no
I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, no, no, no

Can you come over
I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah
Girl, every time you do I just end up
Head all messed up like the sheets where we made love
I've been sober since you broke my heart in two
'Cause drunk me, yeah drunk me, yeah drunk me
Can't get over you, no (there ain't no hangover like you)
Can't get over, can't get over
(There ain't no hangover like you), oh, no, no, no
