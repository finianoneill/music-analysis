[Verse 1]
The way you paint your nails
Is a national joy
You think a rainy day means
You get to stay in bed
You think sprite tastes better from a drive through
You tell anything, I'm on top too
You buy three pairs of shades
'Cause you're gonna lose two

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooo girl, I love that about you
You know you can't do no wrong
Yeah, every time I'm around you
I see a little bit of you that you don't
So unpredictable
You're so unforgettable
So don't go changing no time soon

[Chorus]
'Cause I love that about you
I love that about you, I love that about you
Yeah, I love that about you
Oh girl, I love that about you

[Verse 2]
What's your favourite song?
You change it every day
Just like your favourite drink
One day it's wine then it's Tanqueray
You make thrift store clothes look brand new
You get bored, go get a new tattoo
Yeah, you're beautiful and you ain't got a clue

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooo girl, I love that about you
You know you can't do no wrong
Yeah, every time I'm around you
I see a little bit of you that you don't
So unpredictable
You're so unforgettable
Girl, so don't go changing no time soon

[Chorus]
'Cause I love that about you
I love that about you, I love that about you
Yeah, I love that about you
Oh girl, I love that about you

Ooo girl, I love that about you
You know you can't do no wrong
Yeah, every time I'm around you
I see a little bit of you that you don't
So unpredictable
You're so unforgettable
Girl, so don't go changing no time soon
Oh girl, I love that about you
