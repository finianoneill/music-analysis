[Verse 1]
I could pull in, kill the lights in the driveway
Walk into your door and kiss you in the porch light
Like a gentleman
We could chase a little magic before the sun comes up
Girl, there ain't no reason we gotta rush
Let's make this night move a little bit

[Chorus]
Slower, girl
And take another lap around this ol' town
And let the radio take us where we wanna go
Get a little closer on the side of the road
Somewhere where we know nobody's watching
Get this world revolving a little bit slower
A little bit slower

[Verse 2]
I wanna see you laugh like that in the moonlight
Let you call every shot in the dark
Like a gentleman
I love what you do to me
So let it linger on
Let your kiss fall a little bit

[Chorus]
Slower, girl
And take another lap around this ol' town
And let the radio take us where we wanna go
Get a little closer on the side of the road
Somewhere where we know nobody's watching
Get this world revolving a little bit slower
A little bit slower

[Bridge]
A little bit longer
Laid back, playing the song yeah
Making time freeze, make it all last
Holding on to every drop this moment's got
So let's make this night move a little bit
Make this night move a little bit

[Chorus]
Slower, girl
And take another lap around this ol' town
And let the radio take us where we wanna go
Get a little closer on the side of the road
Somewhere where we know nobody's watching
Get this world revolving a little bit slower
A little bit slower

[Outro]
A little bit slower
A little bit slower
A little bit slower
