Blue Tacoma, California
Rays of gold are shining on ya

[Verse 1]
Wheels rolling on an old Toyota
Twist top on a Sunkist soda
Your brown hair in the west coast wind
If heaven is anywhere
The night is here it's at the top of our lungs
Shuffling in and gonna steal the one
Missing turns cause that's our song
If heaven is anywhere

[Chorus]
It's in a blue Tacoma, California
White magnolia in your hair
Rays of gold are shining on ya
Oooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's never running out of golden road
Always having your hand to hold
It's in a blue Tacoma, California
Oooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's right through the door, California
Rays of gold are shining on ya

[Verse 2]
Red sun melting to the black top
Dollar shades from a nowhere truck stop
Your kiss and that coast line
If heaven is anywhere
Pull it over to the shoulder
To take it in
Mmmh and pull you closer
Loving you longer than I ever did
Going places we never been
Cause heaven's in

[Chorus]
A blue Tacoma, California
White magnolia in your hair
Rays of gold are shining on ya
Oooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's never running out of golden road
Always having your hand to hold
In a blue Tacoma, California
Oooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's right here

Blue Tacoma, California
Rays of gold are shining on ya
If heaven is anywhere

It's in a blue Tacoma, California
White magnolia in your hair
Rays of gold are shining on ya
Oooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's never running out of golden road
Always having your hand to hold
In a blue Tacoma, California
Oooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's right through the door, California
Oooh, if heaven is anywhere
Rays of gold are shining on ya

Blue Tacoma, California
Rays of gold are shining on ya

If heaven is anywhere
