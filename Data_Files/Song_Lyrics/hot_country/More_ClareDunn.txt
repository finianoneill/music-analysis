[Prelude]
I got it good girl 'cause I got myself a good girl
Yeah you up and took my whole world and made it so good girl

[Verse 1]
You're an angel, you're a keeper, the kinda thing that you gotta lock down
I'm lovin' just livin' every minute since you came around
I was lost in the neon lights 'til the day that you called me yours
Yeah they say when you know you know, and I know one thing's for sure

[Chorus]
I got it good girl 'cause I got myself a good girl
Still can't believe I found you, can't imagine life without you
I could take you home to Mama, take you to the church right down the street
Yeah you up and took my whole world and made it so good girl
Aw so good baby, yeah

[Verse 2]
You know sometimes I dream 'bout 55 years from now
Gonna still be me you and me watchin' that sun goin' down
I'll still be stealin' your kisses, I'll still be holdin' your hand
I still look at you and I pinch myself, good Lord I'm a lucky man

[Chorus]
I got it good girl 'cause I got myself a good girl
Still can't believe I found you, can't imagine life without you
I could take you home to Mama, take you to the church right down the street
Yeah you up and took my whole world and made it so good girl
Aw so good baby

[Bridge]
I was lost in the neon lights 'til the day that you called me yours
And they say when you know you know, and I know one thing's for sure

[Chorus]
I got it good girl 'cause I got myself a good girl
Still can't believe I found you, can't imagine life without you
I could take you home to Mama, take you to the church right down the street
Yeah you up and took my whole world and made it so good girl
Aw so good baby

[Outro]
('Cause I got myself a) good girl
(Still can't believe I) I found you
Good Lord I'm a lucky man
I could take you home to Mama, take you to the church right down the street
Yeah you up and took my whole world and made it so good girl
Aw so good baby
