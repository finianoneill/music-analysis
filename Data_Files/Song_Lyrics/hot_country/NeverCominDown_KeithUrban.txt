[Verse 1]
I can feel it coming on now
As the music plays
Taking shots with the night owls
As the world just fades away
Got a paycheck in my pocket
'Bout to get it all good
Light it up like a rocket
We're going all night long

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody sing ooh, mmm
I love it when you ooh

[Chorus]
When the sun goes down, stars come out
It's a, can you feel it?
When I take you by the hand, dancin’
And we pass it around, ‘round, ‘round
It was so high, we can paint the sky
Tear the top right off the ceiling
And I swear we're never, ever coming down
Never coming down

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, ooh yeah
It's coming down, can you feel it?
Oh, oh
Never, ever, never coming down

[Verse 2]
Well the band's on fire
And the beer is ice cold
We're going down to the wire
Then we'll all go rolling home
And maybe we'll keep it going
'Til we see that sun
Coming up right here, right now
I wanna see you move and hear you sing it out loud

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh

[Chorus]
When the sun goes down, stars come out
It's a, can you feel it?
When I take you by the hand, dancin’
And we pass it around, ‘round, ‘round
It was so high, we can paint the sky
Tear the top right off the ceiling
And I swear we're never, ever coming down
Never coming down

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, ooh yeah
It's coming down, can you feel it?
Oh, oh
Never, ever, never coming down
Oh, oh, ooh yeah
It's coming down, can you feel it?
Oh, oh
Never coming down

[Bridge]
Dance, baby, dance, baby
Don't stop now
Dance, baby, dance, baby
Don't stop now
I said oh now, oh now, oh now, oh now
Dance, baby, dance, baby
I said oh now, oh now, oh now, oh now
Wait a minute, baby, tell me one more time
She said oh now, oh now, oh now, oh now
Dance, baby, dance, baby
Oh now, oh now, oh now, oh now

[Chorus]
When the sun goes down, stars come out
It's a, can you feel it?
When I take you by the hand, dancin’
And we pass it around, ‘round, ‘round
It was so high, we can paint the sky
With the love right now, we feel it
And I swear we're never, ever coming down
Never coming down
Never coming down

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, ooh yeah
It's coming down, can you feel it?
Oh, oh
Never coming down
Oh, oh, ooh yeah
It's coming down, can you feel it?
Oh, oh
Never coming down
