[Verse 1]
I'm just flesh and bone, heart and soul
And I've earned a couple scars
I've let once in a lifetime kind of things slide right out of my arms
I've struck out, I've been knocked down more times than I can count
But that don't matter now

[Chorus]
'Cause when you smile
I see the sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt
Because of you, I'm not the man I was before you
I'm not saying that I'm perfect
Oh 'cause girl you know I'm not
But I'll love you with everything I've got
Girl I'll give you my best shot

[Verse 2]
You saw a spark inside of me that no one else could find
Your good morning eyes, they get me high
Girl you're always on my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause when you smile
I see the sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt
Because of you, I'm not the man I was before you
I'm not saying that I'm perfect
Oh 'cause girl you know I'm not
But I'll love you with everything I've got
Girl I'll give you my best shot

[Bridge]
When I saw you for the first time
I knew I'd found amazing grace
It's like angels singing every time I hear your name
'Cause when you smile
I see the sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt
Because of you, I'm not the man I was before you

[Chorus]
When you smile
I see the sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt
Because of you, I'm not the man I was before you
I'm not saying that I'm perfect
Oh, God knows I'm not
But I'll love you with everything I've got
Girl I'll give you my best shot

[Outro]
I'm gonna give you, give you my best shot
I'm gonna give you, give you, yeah
