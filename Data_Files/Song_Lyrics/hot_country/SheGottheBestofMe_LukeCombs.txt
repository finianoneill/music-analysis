[Verse 1: Luke Combs]
Seventeen, you don't think that much about life
You just live it
Like Kerosene dancing around a fire
But you're in it

[Pre-Chorus: Luke Combs]
So you jump right in
Ain't afraid to fall
And you give it all

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different sound
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
She got the best of me

[Verse 2: Luke Combs]
I picked myself up off the floor
And found something new worth living for
And a, old dusty hand-me-down six string
And a couple chords

[Bridge: Luke Combs]
I'm getting over her
A little more with every song
So sing a-long

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different sound
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
She got the best of me

[Outro: Luke Combs]
She got the best of me
She got the best of me
She got the best of me
