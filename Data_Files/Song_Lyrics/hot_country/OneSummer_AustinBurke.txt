[Verse 1]
High school caps were flying
We were singing and high-fiving
Yeah, the next thing
We were driving down the five and so alive
As the blue sky kissed the ocean
Turned into a red sunset
We knew we had to grow up
Didn't have to grow up yet
It was Connor, me and Kevin
Hell bent on having fun
We were bad at holding liquor
But we were good at being young
Oh and then there was that one
You know the girl you can't forget?
Who made me fall in love
Before I knew what love meant

[Chorus]
Everybody has that one summer, that one kiss
That one moment that goes something like this
She said 'my parents are out of town
Do you wanna stick around?'
Yeah, you stuck around
Everybody has that one touch that was too good
It was hotter than July, wouldn't stop even if you could
Ain't funny looking back
How you thought you'd have a million others?
But there'll never be another like that
One summer

[Verse 2]
That summer came wind
Never thought that it would end
Yeah, we scattered like September leaves blowing in the wind
Kevin went to 'Bama, Connor moved to Tennessee
As for her, I haven't heard a word
But I see her in my dreams

[Chorus]
Everybody has that one summer, that one kiss
That one moment that goes something like this
She said 'my parents are out of town
Do you wanna stick around?'
Yeah, you stuck around
Everybody has that one touch that was too good
It was hotter than July, wouldn't stop even if you could
Ain't funny looking back
How you thought you'd have a million others?
But there'll never be another like that
One summer

[Bridge]
Yeah, that one summer, that one kiss
That one moment that went something like this
She said 'my parents are out of town
Do you wanna stick around?'
Yeah, I stuck around

[Chorus]
That one touch that was too good
It was hotter than July, wouldn't stop even if you could
Ain't funny looking back
How you thought you'd have a million others?
But there'll never be another like that
One summer
Yeah, that one summer
Everybody has that one summer
