[Verse 1]
The girl's got her eyes on
The fading horizon
Here come the last line of our favorite song
It's the end of an era
She's gonna tear up
That interstate on her way to Charleston

[Chorus]
She's gone
Movin' on, takin' off my letter jacket
Gonna drive as far as she can tonight
Gonna sleep on the roadside
She'll know when her hometown country station turns to static
She ain't never been that far from home
But I know she's better off gone

[Verse 2]
We all knew she was too good for Kansas
She swears we'll end up together in the end
She wouldn't have to say that if she really thought that
The fact is she ain't coming back again

[Chorus]
She's gone
Movin' on, takin' off my letter jacket
Gonna drive as far as she can tonight
Gonna sleep on the roadside
She'll know when her hometown country station turns to static
She ain't never been that far from home
But I know she's better off gone

[Bridge]
Only good thing I ever had
Just up and gone away like that
I love her enough to not hold on
It's gonna break my heart
But I'll get along
Cause she's better off gone

[Chorus]
She's gone
Movin' on, takin' off my letter jacket
Gonna drive as far as she can tonight
Gonna sleep on the roadside
She'll know when her hometown country station turns to static
She ain't never been that far from home
But I know she's better off gone
