[Verse 1]
Hashtag "no filter"
Said a lot of stuff that I don't remember
Lord knows, I'm guilty
Of a lot of sins that I don't wanna live with
Mama'd probably cut me off the family tree
If she heard half the stories people tellin' me

[Verse 2]
Oh s***, there's proof
Insta's out there telling all my truth
I can't lie so I own it
Been a rough week, so what? I deserve it
Sorry to the Uber guy that took me home
It's kinda sad but I'm kinda glad I'm waking up alone

[Chorus]
I started with one shot
To have a good time
Everybody knows how easy one can turn into five
Don't judge me, 'cause it ain't nobody's life but mine
And I only get one shot
So I take it one shot at a time

Yeah
Take it one shot at a time
Hey
One shot at a time

[Verse 3]
Mess up, live and learn
Repent and repeat, build the bridges and burn it
No shame, just secrets
Got a lot of memories, not a lot of regrets
Every time I said I'd never do it again
Was right before I headed out for one more spin

[Chorus]
I started with one shot
To have a good time
Everybody knows how easy one can turn into five
Don't judge me, 'cause it ain't nobody's life but mine
And I only get one shot
So I take it one shot at a time

Yeah
Take it one shot at a time
Hey
One shot at a time

[Bridge]
I think my fear of missing out
Makes me do the one thing I could do without

[Chorus]
It starts with one shot
To have a good time
Everybody knows how easy one can turn into five
Don't judge me, 'cause it ain't nobody's life but mine
And I only get one shot
So I take it one shot at a time

Yeah
Take it one shot at a time
One shot at a time

One shot at a time
One shot at a time
