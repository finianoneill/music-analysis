[Intro]
Yeah baby, I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like–

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
Now I like dollars, I like diamonds, I like stunting, I like shining
I like million dollar deals, where's my pen? Bitch I'm signin' (signin')
I like those Balenciagas (those), the ones that look like socks
I like going to the jeweler, I put rocks all in my watch (cha-ching)
I like texts from my exes when they want a second chance (what?)
I like proving niggas wrong, I do what they say I can't (she can't)
They call me Cardi Bardi, banging body, spicy mami, hot tamale
Hotter than a Somali, fur coat, Ferrari
Hop out the stu', jump in the coupe (coupe)
Big Dipper on top of the roof
Flexing on bitches as hard as I can
Eating halal, driving the Lam'
Told that bitch I'm sorry though (sorry)
'Bout my coins like Mario (Mario)
Yeah, they call me Cardi B
I run this shit like cardio

[Pre-Chorus]
I said I like it like...
I said I like it like...
I said I like it like...
I said I like it like that

[Chorus: Cardi B]
Oh, I need the dollars, cha-ching
Beat it up like piñatas
Tell the driver, close the curtains
Bad bitch make you nervous

[Verse 2: Bad Bunny]
Chambean, chambean, pero no jalan (¡jalan!)
Tú compras to'a las Jordan, bo', a mí me las regalan (hehe-he)
I spend in the club (wouh), what you have in the bank (yeh)
This is the new religion, bang, it's Latino gang, gang, yeh

[Interlude]
Bad Bunny, be, be, be, be, be, be
The Latino, the latino, the latino, the latino
Bad Bunny, be, be, be, be, be, be
The Latino, the latino, the latino, the latino
The Latino, the latino, the latino, the latino gang, gang, yeh
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
Latino gang (baby)
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang

[Verse 3: J Balvin]
I said it like it like–
Como Celia Cruz tengo el azúcar (azúca')
Tu jeva me vio y se fue de pecho como Jimmy Snuka (ah)
Te vamos tumbar la peluca
Y arranca pal' carajo, cabrón, que a ti no te vo'a pasar la hookah (hookah, hookah)
Mis tenis Balenciaga me reciben en la entrada (wouh)
Pa-pa-pa-parazzi, like I'm Lady Gaga (wouh)
Y no te me hagas
Que en cover de Billboard tú has visto mi cara
No salgo de tu mente
Donde quieras que viajes has escuchado "Mi Gente"

[Bridge: Cardi B, J Balvin]
I said I like it like that
I said I like it like that (rrr)
I said I like it like that
I said I like it like that, that, that, that...
I said I like it like that

[Post-Bridge]
I said I like it like–
I said I like it like– (woo)
I said I like it like–
I said I like it like that

[Outro: Cardi B]
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like that
I said I like it like that
