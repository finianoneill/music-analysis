Ughh
Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Hook]
I was broke now a young nigga flexed up
In a foreign switchin' lanes you can’t catch up
You was hatin’ but you switched up cause I’m next up
I got lean and some forty in my red cup

[Hook]
Bitches changed and act like I ain’t noticed
Gettin’ money nigga that’s my main focus
Wit .223 and you act like you don’t know this
Bro popped a bean, me and my niggas always rollin'

[Verse 1]
You're tweaking
Me and KK Wild, we always geekin'
Leakin, yeah my fours leave yo body leaking
I be road runnin' every season
And I just count the bands, my neck is freezin'
Me JD, linked with South End, we was thuggin'
Outside totin rachets, holdin' on the work we runnin'
Now we counting bands yeah my niggas always thumbin'
And we don’t give a fuck cause my niggas always drummin'
I was watching steady plottin', pistol totin'
Mixing beans with my lean, that shit had me floating

Young nigga wrote it (How to flex)
