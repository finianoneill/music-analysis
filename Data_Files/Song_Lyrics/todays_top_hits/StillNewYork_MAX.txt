[Intro: MAX]
Ooh-oh
Yeah, no matter where we go, we still New York, man
Ooh-oh

[Verse 1: MAX]
You were the best nights of my life
You got the light that always shines
I miss the way that you move and the way I get high
When you take me to your heights
Like I'm standing in the sky

[Pre-Chorus: MAX]
I see your subway cars, and your old graffiti
I breathe your air when I land in another city
I'll be that one that's got you printed on my bones
Yeah, you're all I know

[Chorus: MAX]
Everywhere I go, I ain't changed at all
Always on my road
I'm still New York
You're the only home that I'll ever know
My concrete walls
I'm still New York
I'm still New York
Oh, I'm still New York

[Verse 2: MAX]
I wanna drive down Riverside
See the birds flying on the high line
Where the sidewalks burn
And we pray for rain in July
I want the Yankees '99
And the Knicks on a sold out night
When the curtains close, and the Broadway streets are alive

[Pre-Chorus: MAX]
I need your heartbeat close, don't you ever leave me
And I breathe your air when I land in another city
And I'll be that one that's got you printed on my bones
Yeah, you're all I know

[Chorus: MAX]
Everywhere I go, I ain't changed at all
Always on my road
I'm still New York
You're the only home that I'll ever know
My concrete walls
I'm still New York

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Yeah, BK born and raised, I was Godsent
I used to hit the courts out in Prospect
Taking long walks on my time spent
Just a kid with that Empire State of Mindset
Keep flipping off a blind deck
Dipping from the New York cities finest
Yeah, said l've been up on my New York shit
Walking down the block with my New York bitch
I could never leave my city, ain't nothing like it
Even if I do though, I could never hide it
Top down on the West side when I'm driving
East side be the only side that I'm riding

[Bridge: Joey Bada$$ & MAX]
I'm still New York
I'm still New York
I'm still New York
I'm still New York, ooh
And I'm still New York
I'm still New York
I'm still New York
I'm still New York

[Chorus: MAX]
Everywhere I go, I ain't changed at all
Always on my road
I'm still New York
You're the only home that I'll ever know
My concrete walls
I'm still New York
I'm still New York
I'm still New York
And everywhere I go, I ain't changed at all
I ain't changed at all
I'm still New York
