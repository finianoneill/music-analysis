[Intro]
O-o-o-o-o-oh
O-o-o-o-o-oh

[Verse 1]
I didn't know that I was broken
Until I found my missing piece
It seemed like every door was closing on me
And you were so far out of reach

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Drunk on the night, you got lips like your wine
I got nothing but time for you
Feeling so high on that look in your eyes
I got nothing but time for you

[Chorus]
(O-o-o-o-o-oh)
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe (o-o-o-o-o-oh)
That loneliness is my decease (o-o-o-o-o-oh)
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe (o-o-o-o-o-oh)
That you are the remedy-y-y-y-y (o-o-o-o-o-oh)
That you are the remedy-y-y-y-y (o-o-o-o-o-oh)
That you are the remedy

[Verse 2]
I didn't have no one to turn to
Yeah, I was circling the drain, mhm
Now you show me I can learn too, yeah
How to be okay again, ooh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Feeling so high on that look in your eyes
I got nothing but time for you, ooh

[Chorus]
(O-o-o-o-o-oh)
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe (o-o-o-o-o-oh)
That loneliness is my decease (o-o-o-o-o-oh)
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe (o-o-o-o-o-oh)
That you are the remedy-y-y-y-y-y
(You are, you are, yeah)
(You are, you are, yeah)
That you are the remedy-y-y-y-y-y (o-o-o-o-o-oh)
(You are, you are, yeah)
Yeah, you are the remedy

[Bridge]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
(O-o-o-o-o-oh)
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
That loneliness is my decease
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
That you are the remedy-y-y-y-y-y

[Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe (o-o-o-o-o-oh)
(I believe it, I believe it)
That loneliness is my decease (not easy)
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
(I believe it now)
That you are the remedy-y-y-y-y-y
(You are the remedy, oh yeah, yeah oh)
You are the remedy-y-y-y-y-y
You are the remedy, oh yeah (o-o-o-o-o-oh)
You are the remedy
