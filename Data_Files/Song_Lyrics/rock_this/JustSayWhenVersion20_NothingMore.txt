[Verse 1]
We used to dream
We used to name the stars
Tracing futures lying in the dark
They said we'd never last
The brightest flame burns fast
We say words
But we don't talk anymore

[Chorus]
Tonight we're growing closer
Closer to the end
Were we fools for each other
Or fools for falling in?
Are we looking at forever?
'Cause I don't see it in your eyes
Have you had enough or do we try again?
The glass was half full when we stopped pouring in
So just say when

[Verse 2]
I see that sunset in your eyes again
I got that sinking, sinking, same feeling
They said we'd never last
And they were right, but I can't help looking back

[Chorus]
Tonight we're growing closer
Closer to the end
Were we fools for each other
Or fools for falling in?
Are we looking at forever?
'Cause I don't see it in your eyes
Have you had enough or do we try again?
The glass was half full when we stopped pouring in
So just say when

[Bridge]
Oh, we keep circling; it never ends
We keep breaking down but never bend
Oh, we've been half alive
We've been half alive for way too long

[Chorus]
Tonight we're growing closer
Closer to the end
Were we fools for each other
Or fools for falling in?
Are we looking at forever?
'Cause I don't see it in your eyes
Have you had enough or do we try again?
The glass was half full when we stopped pouring in
So just say when
So just say when
