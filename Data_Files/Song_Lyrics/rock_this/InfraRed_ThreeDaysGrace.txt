[Intro]
(From the darkness I see the light in you)

[Verse 1]
Don't stress, don't stress
No one knows what goes on in our heads, our heads
We are invisible to the rest, the rest
They don't know nothing 'bout what we have, we have

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause everyone's living in black and white
But we see each other in a different light

[Chorus]
Infra-red
I Know that youâ€™re burning up for me
Fire in your bloodstream
Moving through you at light-speed
I see you, I see you in Infra-red
The heat and the light and the way you move
Like nobody else is in the room
I see you, I see you

[Verse 2]
It's okay, okay
They won't understand us anyway, no
You and I are on a different wave
So, doesn't even matter what they say

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause everyone's living in black and white
But we see each other in a different light

[Chorus]
Infra-red
I know that you're burning out for me
Fire in your bloodstream
Moving through you at light-speed
I see you, I see you in Infra-red
The heat and the light and the way you move
Like nobody else is in the room
I see you, I see you

[Bridge]
Everyone's living in black and white
We see each other in a different light
That's why I look at you like I do
Like nobody else is even in the room
We see each other in a different light

[Chorus]
Infra-red
I know that you're burning out for me
Fire in your bloodstream
Moving through you at light-speed
I see you, I see you in Infra-red
The heat and the light and the way you move
Like nobody else is in the room
If you fall into me, I fall into you
I see you, I see you
(From the darkness I see the light in you)
