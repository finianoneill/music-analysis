[Verse 1]
I'm so pathetic for ever thinking I'd change
When there are pieces of my past that I conveniently erased
I fell in over my head, you wouldn't understand
And now my brain is just a tired mess
Of all the things I've abandoned

[Pre-Chorus]
And you should know
You never were an exception
I think I shut you out as a form of protection
Now there's an empty space
That's growing in my head and in my home
Starting to show, I thought you should know

[Chorus]
You can fall to your knees and pray
'Cause I'm a sinner now
And I won't be saved
I've been lying to you more each day
'Cause I'm a sinner now
In all my sins I've found
They won't wash away

[Verse 2]
I let you down, it's what I always do best
I found my way under your skin and somehow crept into your chest
There's all the hours I wasted trying hard to fool you
Well, they were never enough
Never enough to hide all the pain I put you through
(Wash away your sins)

[Chorus]
You can fall to your knees and pray
'Cause I'm a sinner now
And I won't be saved
I've been lying to you more each day
'Cause I'm a sinner now
In all my sins I've found
They won't wash away

[Bridge]
I should be living a life and not trying to fight it
Instead of giving it up I'm just trying to hide it
(Tryna hide it)

[Pre-Chorus]
(You can fall to your knees and pray
'Cause I'm a sinner now) 'Cause I'm a sinner now
(And I won't be saved) I won't be saved
(I've been lying to you more each day) more each day
('Cause I'm a sinner now, I'm a sinner now)

[Chorus]
You can fall to your knees and pray
'Cause I'm a sinner now
And I won't be saved
I've been lying to you more each day
'Cause I'm a sinner now
In all my sins I've found
They won't wash away

[Outro]
(You can fall to your knees and pray
'Cause I'm a sinner now
And I won't be saved, I won't be saved
I've been lying to you more each day
'Cause I'm a sinner now
I'm a sinner now)

(You can fall to your knees and pray
'Cause I'm a sinner now
And I won't be saved, I won't be saved
I've been lying to you more each day
'Cause I'm a sinner now
I'm a sinner now)
