[Intro: Danny Case]
Am I going crazy?
Yeah, I think you made me

[Verse 1: Danny Case & Matt Brandyberry]
I give, you take, you always push me away
I love, you hate, it's always, always the same
You're always taking, taking, never giving back
To me, it's in the past, but tell me how you live with that
You always love to hate with every single breath
But since the disconnect, you see the life you wish you had
Yeah, you see the life you wish you had

[Chorus: Danny Case]
Am I going crazy?
Yeah, I think you made me
'Cause I hate the way that you make me feel
Am I going crazy?

[Verse 2: Danny Case & Matt Brandyberry]
I can't, I won't, won't bend until I break
I do, you don't, it's always, always the same
All I wanted was for you to understand my mind
I'm over standing by your side, it isn't worth the time
All you wanted was to push me somewhere past the line
Push me somewhere out of sight, push me somewhere out of mind

[Chorus: Danny Case]
Am I going crazy?
Yeah, I think you made me
'Cause I hate the way that you make me feel
Am I going crazy?

[Bridge: Danny Case]
Always the same
Always the same
Always the same

[Chorus: Danny Case]
Am I going crazy?
Yeah, I think you made me
'Cause I hate the way that you make me feel
Am I going crazy?
Am I going crazy?
Yeah, I think you made me
Going crazy?
Yeah, I'm going crazy

[Outro: Danny Case]
Am I going crazy?
Yeah, I think you made me
Am I going crazy?
