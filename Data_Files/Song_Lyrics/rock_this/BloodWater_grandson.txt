[Verse 1]
I have lived in darkness
For all my life, I've been pursued
You'd be afraid if you could feel my pain
And if you could see the things I am able to see

[Chorus]
Break me out, break me out
Let me flee
Break me out, break me out
Set me free

[Verse 2]
I hail from the dark side
For all my life, I've been besieged
You'd be scared living with my despair
And if you could feel the things, I am able to feel

[Chorus]
Break me out, break me out
Let me flee
Break me out, break me out
Set me free

[Outro]
Break me out, break me out
Let me flee
Break me out, break me out
Set me free
Save me from the dark side
Break me out, break me out
Set me free
