[Verse 1]
There was a time, took the abuse
Still all accused
Since we fell, stars on fire
Now tighten the noose
Stars on fire, nothing but hell

[Verse 2]
Stuck in a war, cover your eyes
There's been the truth
No DNA, eating away
Just show me the proof
Stars on fire, show me the proof
Show me the truth

[Chorus]
Yeah, this is a crime to remember
Was broken apart
Won't go back together
Yeah, this is a crime to remember
For better for worse
You won't forget forever
Yeah, for better for worse
You won't forget forever
Yeah, show me the truth
Show me the truth

[Verse 3]
Heavy the heart, broken apart
Still never the same
Nowhere to rest, never confess
Still living in chains
Stars on fire, show me the proof
Show me the truth

[Chorus]
Yeah, this is a crime to remember
Was broken apart
Won't go back together
Yeah, this is a crime to remember
For better for worse
You won't forget forever
Yeah, for better for worse
You won't forget forever
Yeah, show me the truth
Show me the truth

[Bridge]
Are we divided, are we united?
Are we divided, are we united?
Are we divided, are we united?

[Chorus]
Yeah, this is a crime to remember
Was broken apart
Won't go back together
Yeah, this is a crime to remember
For better for worse
You won't forget forever
Yeah, for better for worse
You won't forget forever
Yeah, this is a crime to remember
For better for worse
You won't forget forever

[Outro]
Are we divided, are we united?
For better for worse
You won't forget forever
Are we divided, are we united?
Show me the truth, show me the truth
