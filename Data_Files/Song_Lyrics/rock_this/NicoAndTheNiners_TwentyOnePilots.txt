[Verse 1]
I see through your eyes
You breathe with my lungs
I strain with your ear to make out
The words your mother sung
I bless with your hand (I bless with your hand)
You pray on my knees (you pray on my knees)
It's my blood in your veins
And your heart is beating in me

[Chorus]
Finally when will it be enough
To find there's no them
There is only us
There's only us

[Verse 2]
I strike with your fist
You shoot with my gun
We spit in your face with my mouth
And curse me with your tongue
We cast us aside (we cast us aside)
We silence our plea (we silence our plea)
But the system that terrifies you
Should terrify me

[Chorus]
Finally when will it be enough
To find there's no them
There is only us
Finally when will it be enough
To find there's no them
There is only us
There's only us

[Bridge]
We burn at our stakes
We die by our swords
We choke in our trenches
We drown in our wars
We're locked in our chains
Though we long to be free
We keep building walls
Till it's so hard to see
We are one with everything
We are one
But it's so hard to see

[Chorus]
Finally when will it be enough
To find there's no them
There is only us
Finally when will it be enough
To find there's no them
There is only us
There's only us
