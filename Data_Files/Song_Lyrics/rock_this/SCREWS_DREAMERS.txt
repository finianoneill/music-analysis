[Verse 1]
Don't take your time
Don't take it easy on me
'Cause I'm running wild
Hot like a broken machine

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell it like it is
Wash away my sins
Digging up the bones inside my head

[Chorus]
All I needed was to hear the truth
I'm lying naked and my brain has lost its screws
I hid away inside a lonely room
Never as lonely as when I'm alone with you

[Verse 2]
I'm such a wreck
Toxic is tasting so sweet
Don't let me rest
Stuck in this static TV

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell it like it is
Wash away my sins
Digging up the bones inside my head

[Chorus]
All I needed was to hear the truth
I'm lying naked and my brain has lost its screws
I hid away inside a lonely room
Never as lonely as when I'm alone with you

[Refrain]
Ah, alone with you, ah
Ah, alone with you, ah
My brain!
My brain!
My brain!
My brain!

[Chorus]
All I needed was to hear the truth
I'm lying naked and my brain has lost its screws
I hid away inside a loaded room
Never as lonely as when I'm alone with you

[Outro]
Ah, alone with you, ah
Ah, alone with you, ah
(Alone, hey, alone)
Alone with you
