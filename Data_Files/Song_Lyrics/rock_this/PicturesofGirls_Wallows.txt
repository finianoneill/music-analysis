[Verse 1]
I see the end, you wait for nothing
You and I, we grew up in the suburbs
Now you're gone, the city's down a number
It is not the same without you around
Oh

[Verse 2]
I see you there, still shy but smiling
Now I find it hard to remember
All the times I tried to forget her
I'm hanging on to something real

[Chorus]
'Cause pictures of girls are not for me, you see

[Bridge]
You should be down in Hollywood
(You should be down in Hollywood)
You should be down in Hollywood
(You should be down in Hollywood)
You should be down in Hollywood
(You should be down in Hollywood)
You should be down in Hollywood
(You should be down in Hollywood)
You should be down in Hollywood
(You should be down in Hollywood)

[Outro]
You should be down in Hollywood
(You should be down in Hollywood)
You should be down in Hollywood
(You should be down in Hollywood)
You should be down in Hollywood
(You should be down in Hollywood)
You should be down in Hollywood
(You should be down in Hollywood)
