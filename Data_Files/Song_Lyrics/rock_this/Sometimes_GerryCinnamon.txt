[Verse 1: Gerry Cinnamon]
Sometimes, just sometimes
Maybe more than some of the time
I'm on a false ego trip
Insecurity is rife
I'm not the ideal person
To be lecturing of life
But if you wanna know
Some things I've learned about myself
Been in sticky situations
I won't bore you with the filth
Breaking bones and sniffing gear
Pouring blood and sweat and tears
In a nutshell I suppose
It's the way the water flows
Yeah that's the way the story goes

[Verse 2: Gerry Cinnamon]
Sometimes, just sometimes
Well alright, maybe all of the time
I'm on a false ego trip
And I'm a renegade of sorts
I roam the concrete jungle
Hunting idiots for sport
And now the cocaine scene
It picked me up and made me frown
That's when joking says that music helps the medicine go down
Hey, it makes you feel alive
More like demons in the night
Flinging powder up your nose
It's the way the water flows
Yeah that's the way the story goes

[Refrain: Gerry Cinnamon]
Sometimes
Just sometimes

[Verse 3: Gerry Cinnamon]
And now the world outside
Don't look the same for you and me
Drinking cider on a golf course
Just a distant memory
Down the park and pick a fight
Popping pills all through the night
Fucking waster I suppose
That's the way the water flows
Yeah that's the way the story goes

[Outro: Gerry Cinnamon]
Sometimes
Just sometimes
Sometimes
Just sometimes
Just sometimes
