[Intro]
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
Pick up the phone

[Verse 1]
You said it yourself you're scared of being alone
You said it yourself that you can crack the code
But the static you hear automatically keeps you exposed, on your own
I hope you're ready, steady, smashing through the levy
The drama, the trauma, don't play the prima donna
My God
You said it yourself that you would never stop
Until you felt the needle drop

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you pack your bags, the party's such a drag
And everyone can tell that you're poisoning the well
But there are no mistakes, except what you create
You need to know your place

[Chorus]
'Cause it's about to get heavy (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
It's about to be on (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
Yeah, I'm bangin' slingin' napalm (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
So nobody move
'Cause I was sent to warn you
The devil's in the next room

[Verse 2]
The silence, the silence
The blinding ultra violence
Knockin' at your door (Hey)
Pacin' back and forth
What now? (What now)
The whispers and the screams
The stereotypical profiling ritual
Vicious and obscene

[Pre-Chorus]
So now you pack your bags, the party's such a drag
And everyone can tell that you're poisoning the well
But there are no mistakes, except what you create
You need to know your place

[Chorus]
'Cause it's about to get heavy (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
It's about to be on (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
Yeah, I'm bangin' slingin' napalm (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
So nobody move
'Cause I was sent to warn you
The devil's in the next room

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
'Cause it's about to get heavy (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
It's about to be on (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
Yeah, I'm bangin' slingin' napalm (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
So nobody move
'Cause I was sent to warn you
The devil's in the next room

[Outro]
(Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
Yeah the devil's in the next room
(Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
Yeah the devil's in the next room
(Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)
So nobody move
'Cause I was sent to warn you
The devil's right beside you
