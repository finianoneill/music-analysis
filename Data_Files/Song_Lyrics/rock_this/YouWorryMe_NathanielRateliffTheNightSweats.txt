[Verse 1]
I'm alright today
You gonna find a way to cross and you gonna get there
And I'm on fire today
Ain't no water here to calm or even put me out
I'll find a better way
Am I crazy or the wind is gonna blow me down?

[Chorus]
I'm gonna leave it all out there to dry
I'm gonna leave it all out there
I'm gonna leave it all out there to dry up
I'm gonna leave it all out there

[Verse 2]
You seem tired today
Were you up all night afraid of what the future might bring?
I feel fine today
I had dreams of you in places I've not seen before
You get so carried away
Like lovers new to bodies first to touch you here
This ain't a getaway
You build walls around your heart to try to lock it in

[Chorus]
I'm gonna leave it all out there to dry
I'm gonna leave it all out there
I'm gonna leave it all out there to dry up
I'm gonna leave it all out there

[Bridge]
And upon the wind it's carried
Over the cities and the plains
You got time you're on the mend babe
And everybody wants the same
Everybody wants the same thing

[Chorus]
I'm gonna leave it all out there to dry
I'm gonna leave it all out there
I'm gonna leave it all out there to dry up
I'm gonna leave it all out there

[Outro]
But you worry me
You worry me
You worry me
You worry me
You worry me
You worry me
