I said that I hate you
I watched you walk out the room
Now it's five hours later
And I still can't get through to you

You said I'm a faker
And now I know what I gotta do
And it's five days later
And I got somethin' to say to you

There's only ever been one
There's only ever been one
There's only ever been one

You think I'm a liar
But you don't know the truth
But now it's five weeks later
And I'm not gettin' over you

And all I'm left with is pictures
Of all the things that we'll never do
And it's five months later
And I wish I told you

There's only ever been one
There's only ever been one
There's only ever been one
There's only ever been one
There's only ever been one

There's only ever been one
There's only ever been one

There's only ever been one
And I said I'd get over you
There's only ever been one
And I watched you walk out the room
There's only ever been one
And I said I'd get over you
There's only ever been one
I'm not getting over you
There's only ever been one
