[Verse 1]
I've been away, a little while
Sometimes I just can't help myself
When my mind's running wild
I seem to lose grip on reality
And I try to disregard
The crazy things the voices tell me to do
But it's no use (use–use–use–)
I tried to own it, write songs about it
Believe me, I tried, but in the end, I needed to breathe
Find inspiration, some kind of purpose
To take a second to face the shit that makes me, me

[Chorus]
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud
Every moment, every second, every trespass
Every awful thing, every broken dream
A couple of years back and forth with myself in a cage
Banging my head 'gainst the wall, tryna' put words on a page
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To be alone in a room, alone in a room

[Verse 2]
I saw the world a couple of times
Tried to cure the ache with absence
But that hole was still a hole
And my mind kept playing tricks on me
Feeling older every day
Took everything I had to not crash and burn
But I'm starting to learn
Sometimes I'll fall down, sometimes I'll lose hope
But those days will be few if I keep my feet on the ground
I might be lonely, but I ain't alone here
So I keep pushing the limits of what makes me, me

[Chorus]
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud
Every moment, every second, every trespass
Every awful thing, every broken dream
A couple of years back and forth with myself in a cage
Banging my head against the wall, tryna' put words on a page
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To be alone in a room, alone in a room

[Bridge]
(Lonely–lonely–lonely–lonely–lonely–)
I can be
Better than I was
I can be
Better than I am
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room

[Chorus]
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To sit alone in a room and say it all out loud
Every moment, every second, every trespass
Every awful thing, every broken dream
A couple of years back and forth with myself in a cage
Banging my head against the wall, tryna' put words on a page
All I needed was the last thing I wanted
To be alone in a room, alone in a room
