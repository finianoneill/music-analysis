[Verse 1]
Called to the ring
Taking me round by round
It hurts and it stings
Taking me down, down, down

[Pre-Chorus]
You think that you caught me
I can hear you taunt me
Fractured and I'm falling down
My enemy is watching me bleed

[Chorus]
I'm not dead yet
So watch me burn
Go on trying, lying, you're so sure
I may be broken
But I'm not done
I'll go on fighting, while there's breath in my lungs
'Cause I'm not dead yet
No, I'm not dead yet

[Verse 2]
You wait for the day
That I'll be counted out
You stand at my grave
Already breaking ground

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't think you know me
There's a side you don't see
Been to hell and made it out
My enemy, I'll watch you bleed

[Chorus]
I'm not dead yet
So watch me burn
Go on trying, lying, you're so sure
I may be broken
But I'm not done
I'll go on fighting, while there's breath in my lungs
'Cause I'm not dead yet
No, I'm not dead yet

[Bridge]
I'm still awake
I won't go away
It's gonna take more than you can bring
Calling my name
Heaven is calling my name

[Chorus]
I'm not dead yet
So watch me burn
Go on trying, lying, you're so sure
I may be broken
But I'm not done
I'll go on fighting, while there's breath in my lungs
'Cause I'm not dead yet
No, I'm not dead yet

[Outro]
I'm still awake
I won't go away
It's gonna take more than you can bring
