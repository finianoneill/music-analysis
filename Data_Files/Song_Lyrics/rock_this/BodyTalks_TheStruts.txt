[Verse 1]
Your eyes follow like a spotlight
Two eyes like the sun
Go ahead, keep your distance from me
Soon you're gonna come
When you flick your hair like you don't care
And you're asking where I'm from
That game that you're running, baby
You've already won

[Pre-Chorus]
I need to know, know, know
What do you need, need, need?
What do you like, like, like?
Cause I'm gonna be it tonight

[Chorus]
You can be cool, you can be shy
Say what you want, say what you like
Cause ooh, your body talks, your body talks
Ooh-ooh, your body talks
You can pretend you don't want it now
But I read the signs from your head to your toes
Yeah, you don't need to say a word cause
Ooh, ooh your body talks

[Verse 2]
Your lips are a conversation
That face is a song
If it's my imagination
Stop me if I'm wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
I need to know, know, know
What do you need, need, need?
What do you like, like, like?
Cause I'm gonna be it tonight

[Chorus]
You can be cool, you can be shy
Say what you want, say what you like
Cause ooh, your body talks, your body talks
Ooh-ooh, your body talks
You can pretend you don't want it now
But I read the signs from your head to your toes
Yeah, you don't need to say a word cause
Ooh, ooh your body talks

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Ooh, your body talks, your body talks
Ooh, your body talks

[Chorus]
You can be cool, you can be shy
Say what you want, say what you like
Cause ooh, your body talks, your body talks
Ooh-ooh, your body talks
You can pretend you don't want it now
But I read the signs from your head to your toes
Yeah, you don't need to say a word cause
Ooh, ooh your body talks

Ooh ooh ooh ooh oh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh oh
(Talk to me)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh oh
(You don't wanna be shy)
Oooh

[Outro]
Shake your hips
(Ooh ooh)
It's on your lips
You don't need to say a word cause
Ooh-ooh, your body talks
