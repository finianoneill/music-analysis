[Verse 1: Cardinal Copia]
You'll soon be hearing the chime
Close to midnight
If I could turn back the time
I'd make all right

[Pre-Chorus: Cardinal Copia]
How could it end like this?
There's a sting in the way you kiss me
Something within your eyes
Said it could be the last time
'Fore it's over!

[Chorus: Cardinal Copia]
Just wanna be
Wanna bewitch you in the moonlight
Just wanna be
I wanna bewitch you all night

[Verse 2: Cardinal Copia]
It keeps on giving me chills
But I know now
I feel the closer we get
To the last bow

[Pre-Chorus: Cardinal Copia]
I donâ€™t wanna end like this (Cataclysm)
But there's sting in the way you kiss me (Armageddon)
Something within your eyes
Said it could be the last time
'Fore it's over!

[Chorus: Cardinal Copia]
Just wanna be
Wanna bewitch you in the moonlight
Just wanna be
I wanna bewitch you all night
Just wanna be
I wanna bewitch you, one last time in the ancient rite
Just wanna be
I wanna bewitch you all night

[Solo: Nameless Ghouls (Fire & Aether)]

[Chorus: Cardinal Copia]
Just wanna be
Wanna bewitch you in the moonlight
Just wanna be
Wanna bewitch you all night
Just wanna be
Wanna bewitch you in the moonlight
Just wanna be
I wanna bewitch you all right

[Outro]
All right!
Woh-woh-woh, wohh!
