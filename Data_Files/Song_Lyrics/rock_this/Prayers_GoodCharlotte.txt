[Verse 1]
Born on a lonely planet full of broken dreams
Where no one understands me
When I finally met an angel, I didn't know what to say
She just held my hand

[Verse 2]
And we would lay awake at night
Looking at the stars, thinking of the ones we've lost
And wonder where they are
When we lit another candle, she asked me who's to blame
Then she put her arms around me and held me to the flames

[Pre-Chorus]
So why do we hurt each other?
We don't need the words for one anothers

[Chorus]
Prayers, they don't mean a thing at all
Do they answer when you call?
These prayers, when you don't mean what you say
Would you die for me today?
No, I just can't relate

[Verse 2]
None of this makes sense in this reality
God just leaves the room when I turn on my TV
I see a little girl who's crying 'cause she lost her family
All these strangers sending thoughts and prayers
She's buried underneath

[Pre-Chorus]
Why do we kill each other?
We can't feel the pain in one anothers

[Chorus]
Prayers, they don't mean a thing at all
Do they answer when you call?
These prayers, when you don't mean what you say
Would you die for me today?
No, I just can't relate

[Bridge]
We're so far away from one another
We keep building walls between each others

[Chorus]
Prayers, they don't mean a thing at all
Do they answer when you call?
These prayers, when you don't mean what you say
Would you die for me today?
No, I just can't relate

[Outro]
(They don't mean a thing at all
Do they answer when you call?
These prayers, when you don't mean what you say
Would you die for me today?)
