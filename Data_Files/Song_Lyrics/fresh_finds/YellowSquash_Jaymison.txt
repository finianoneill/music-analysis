It's a shame the ties that we make
Don't take much to weaken
Even less to break
Seen a lot of motives
Tables reversed
Barely on the surface
Is it even worth it?

Droppin lower
Numb to the pain
Foster the ego
Fuel to the flame
Comin out to hurt you
Void of any virtue
Posted on the sidelines
Callin your name

See, niggas don't call you they mans
'Til they need a hand
Nothin to give
Gonna take 'til the very end
People gon' show who they are
Hope you're listenin
I'ma tell you once again
Pay attention when
Things change as soon as you win
See 'em come around here
Better run faster than they can

Don't call you they mans
'Til they need a hand
Nothin to give
And they take 'til the bitter end
Things change as soon as you win
No matter the way they pretend
Baby, where you stand?

No matter the way they pretend
Baby, where you stand?
