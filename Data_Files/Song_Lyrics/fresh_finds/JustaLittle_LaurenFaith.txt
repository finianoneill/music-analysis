Where do we go from here
Tell me this loud and clear
Cause I don’t want be your secret
(no I don’t wanna be)

Wherever you want to go
Say the word and we’ll go

You know that I’ve waiting for
You to get it
Let’s take this up a little more
This time I’m ready

And

Work it
Make it hot
Oh, need me
Give me just a little bit

Work it

My imagination is the best
I do things I wouldn’t dare in my mind
If all of the thoughts that I had
Would come alive
You’d be by my side

This time I’m ready
You know that I’ve waiting for
You to get it
Let’s take this up a little more

To the place where our hearts just Sail away...
