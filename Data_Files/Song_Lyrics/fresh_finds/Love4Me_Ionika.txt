I'll be chasing with a shame
I'll be caring until it fades, until it fades
In this blue haze with a shame
In this blue haze until it fades
We escaped now

In this blue haze with a shame
In this blue haze until it fades, until it fades
In this blue haze with a shame
In this blue haze until it fades

I'll be chasing with a shame
I'll be caring until it fades, until it fades
In this blue haze with a shame
In this blue haze until it fades
We escaped now
