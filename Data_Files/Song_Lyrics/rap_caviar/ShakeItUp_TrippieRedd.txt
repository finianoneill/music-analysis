[Chorus]
Call 'em by, rub a thigh
Baby shake that ass, shake that pumpkin pie
Twin sisters side by side, shake it side by side
Twin sisters side by side, shake it side by side
Call 'em by, rub a thigh
Baby shake that ass, shake that pumpkin pie
Twin sisters side by side, shake it side by side
Twin sisters side by side, shake it side by side
Twin sisters side by side

[Verse]
Oh baby what you mean
Go and shake that ass, hoe, for big 14
If you want some cash hoe, big ass cheese
Go and shake your ass hoe, like the twerk team
Yeah, she gon' shake it like a red nose
Yeah, to the wall to the window
Put that ass in reverse just like Uno
Told her I'm a big dog just like Cujo
Sing to that bitch like I'm Bruno
Where abouts of your bitch, I'm like who knows
Drop that ass baby, not too low (ey)
Shake that ass bitch just like oo-woah

[Chorus]
Call 'em by, rub a thigh
Baby shake that ass, shake that pumpkin pie
Twin sisters side by side, shake it side by side
Twin sisters side by side, shake it side by side
Call 'em by, rub a thigh
Baby shake that ass, shake that pumpkin pie
Twin sisters side by side, shake it side by side
Twin sisters side by side, shake it side by side
Twin sisters side by side
