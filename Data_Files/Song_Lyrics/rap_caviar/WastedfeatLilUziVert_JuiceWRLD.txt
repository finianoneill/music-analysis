[Intro: Juice WRLD & Lil Pump]
Yeah, no, no, no
No, no, no
Fuck, Perc'
CB on the beat
Perc', bitch

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted
Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted
Wasted

[Post-Chorus: Juice WRLD]
She do cocaine in my basement
I'm a doctor, but I'm runnin' out of patience
She told me that she tryna get closer to Satan
She be talkin' to him when she in the matrix

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Damn, why is she so demonic?
She Medusa with a little Pocahontas
She been lacin' all my drugs or somethin'
'Cause every time that we're together, I'm unconscious
Hold up, let me be honest
I know I saw her put the Percs in my chronic
Smokin' 'til my eyes roll back like the omen
Just another funeral for her, goddamn

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted
Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted
Wasted

[Post-Chorus: Juice WRLD]
She do cocaine in my basement
I'm a doctor, but I'm runnin' out of patience
She told me that she tryna get closer to Satan
She be talkin' to him when she in the matrix

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
Rockstar, that's our style, these boys can't take it (yeah)
Hatin', but they're still tryna take our cadence (woah)
No basic, brand new 'Rari when I'm racin'
Take it, let you roll my weed, please don't lace it, yeah
That's a bum bitch that you chasin', ayy
Foreign with me, she a dominatrix (woah)
I love that girl and I do like her body
"I don't want the money, I just want the molly"
That's what she say when she lived in the Valley
Lil' boy I'm your father, hakuna matata
I made that girl give all of that top up
Got dreads in my head, used to pray for the lock up
I hit from the back and my legs start to lock up
Jacuzzi that booty, I gave that girl flakka
I'm takin' blue caps that keep tweakin' my chakra
Rose on my chain, there's no hint like no copper
Tats in the middle my head like I'm Avatar
That's the reason that I ride on my Appas

[Chorus: Juice WRLD  with Lil Uzi Vert]
Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted (yeah)
Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted
Wasted

[Post-Chorus: Juice WRLD & Lil Uzi Vert]
She do cocaine in my basement (in my basement)
I'm a doctor, but I'm runnin' out of patience (out of patience)
She told me that she tryna get closer to Satan (Satan)
She be talkin' to him when she in the matrix

[Verse 3: Juice WRLD]
My eyes closed, hopin' this ain't make-believe
And she don't know that all her demons live in me, yeah
I don't know, I don't know
Don't know what she been on, I don't know
All that lean I sip on, now watch me pour it
One cup on me, don't got no friends
I'm an open door, I ain't have to let her in
She ain't take my heart, but she took my medicine
Least somebody gon' take it, hate to waste it

[Chorus: Juice WRLD with Lil Uzi Vert]
Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted (yeah)
Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted
Wasted

[Outro: Juice WRLD]
Wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted
