[Verse 1]
You are a star
And I'm just a nobody
Not just a girl
You are a somebody
And I wanna be
That someone for you
You cast your spells
I watch in the movies
Can I pick you up
At 7 o' clock please
'Cause I wanna be
That someone for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know
It's hard for you to see
Just a normal guy like me
Can be just what you need

[Chorus]
But if you would notice me
I'll give you everything
That you are missing
Can I be the ordinary guy for you?
So take a good look at me
I'll show you everything
Cuz you showed me magic
Can I be the ordinary guy for you?
The ordinary guy for you

[Verse 2]
So can I be
Can I be your secret
Just give me your heart
I promise to keep it
'Cause I wanna be that someone for you
And I know that it's hard for you to see
Just a normal guy like me
Can be just what you need

[Chorus]
But if you would notice me
I'll give you everything
That you are missing
Can I be the ordinary guy for you?
So take a good look at me
'Cause I'll show you everything
'Cause you showed me magic
Can I be the ordinary guy for you?
The ordinary guy for you

[Bridge]
Oh, oh ,oh
The ordinary guy for you
So can you notice me?
'Cause I'll give you everything
That you are missing
Can I be the ordinary guy for you?

[Chorus]
But if you would notice me
I'll give you everything
'Cause you showed me magic
Can I be the ordinary guy for you?
The ordinary guy for you

[Outro]
The ordinary guy for you
Oh, oh, oh
The ordinary guy for you
Oh, oh, oh
The ordinary guy for you
