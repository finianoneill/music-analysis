[Verse 1]
I stare you, sometimes at night
Wishing I could jus press rewind
'Cause I just want more
I get confused, sometimes I skip
Can't carry your stuff, am I beginning?
In anything, I just want more

[Chorus]
More of your days
More of your nights
More of your wrongs
More of your rights
Whatever you got, I'll take too
I just want more, more of you
Ooh, more of you
Ooh

[Verse 2]
But is this how got on me
Stronger for gravity
'Cause I just want more
I could spent centuries beside you, behind you
Inside you, forever now
It's not enough, I just want more

[Chorus]
More of your days
More of your nights
More of your dark
More of your light
If you had it lost, I would love her too
I just want more, more of you
I just want more, more of you
Ooh, more of you
Ooh

[Bridge]
More of your days
More of your nights
More of your dark
More of your light
Whatever you got, God done give me too
I just want more, [?] one of you

[Chorus]
More of your laughs
More of your crys
More of your wisdom
That lives in your eyes
In my next life, I'll be looking for you
'Cause I just want more, more of you
Ooh, more of you
Ooh, more of you

[Outro]
Ooh
