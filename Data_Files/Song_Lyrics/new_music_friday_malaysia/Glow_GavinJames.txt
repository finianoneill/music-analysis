[Verse 1]
Lately I've been
Lately I've been losing
If I don't want to go in the morning I'll stay in
Some things you
Some things you can't explain
Someone take me out out the water, out of the rain
Cause I just wanna come back again
Come back again

[Hook]
Oh but I just wanna wait till the sun comes up
The stars in your eyes disappear when you grow up
And soon you'll realise when you're down and you can't get up
That I just wanna wait till
Till the sun comes up

[Verse 2]
When your moving all you ever do is run
You always say the worst is coming when the worst has come
When your feeling black and blue
And when you think the whole world is falling down on you
With all the words that fly at you

[Hook]
Oh but I just wanna wait till the sun comes up
The stars in your eyes disappear when you grow up
And soon you'll realise when you're down and you can't get up
But I just wanna wait till
Till the sun comes up
And o-o-o-oh I just wanna wait till
Till the sun comes up

[Bridge]
It's a hard fight
With these highs and lows
And it's a hard fight
And I think that we should just let this go
When these highs and lows
They don't let you go

[Hook]
Oh but I
Just wanna wait till the sun comes up
The stars in your eyes
Disappear when you grow up
And soon you'll realize
When you're down and you can't get up
That I just wanna wait till
Till the sun comes up
Woah
I just wanna wait till
Till the sun comes up
