[Intro: Marshall Applewhite]
Astro or in old language
A couple thousand years ago, disciples
Those who are trying to prepare themselves
For entry into the evolutionary level, above human
Synonymous with the Kingdom of God
The kingdom of heaven
Heaven, heaven, heaven

[Chorus: Grimes]
My heart, I never feel, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know

[Break: Marshall Applewhite]
Your only chance to survive, or evacuate
Is to leave with us

[Chorus: Grimes]
My heart, I never feel, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know
My heart, I never feel, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know
My heart, I never feel, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know

[Break: Marshall Applewhite]
Then you might survive

[Post-Chorus 1: Grimes]
My, my, my
Ever see, ever be, ever know my heart
Ever see, ever be, ever know my heart

[Refrain: Grimes]
Home, and I know
Playing the deck above
It’s always different
I'm the one in love
Home, and I know
Playing the deck above
It’s always different
I'm the one in love
Home, and I know
Playing the deck above
It’s always different
(I'm the one in love)
I'm the one in love
Home, and I know
Playing the deck above
It’s always different
(I'm the one in love)
I'm the one in love

[Break: Marshall Applewhite]
Who do you think you are?
Rid themselves of human behavior, human activity, human thinking
The kingdom of heaven

[Chorus: Grimes]
My heart, I never feel, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know
Ever see, ever be, ever know my heart
Ever see, ever be, ever know my heart

[Refrain: Grimes]
Home, and I know
Playing the deck above
It’s always different
I'm the one in love
Home, and I know
Playing the deck above
It’s always different
I'm the one in love
Home, and I know–

[Break: Marshall Applewhite]
The planet is about to be recycled
And we see the planet as a stepping stone
Planet earth, a stepping stone

[Refrain: Grimes]
Home, and I know
Playing the deck above
It’s always different
I'm the one in love

[Ending: Marshall Applewhite]
The kingdom of heaven
