[Intro]
Woah
(Know my body, show my body)
Oh, yeah
Na-na-na na-na-na na-na-na-na na-na-na na-na-na
Na-na-na na-na-na na-na-na-na na-na-na na-na-na

[Verse 1]
Chest-to-chest, face-to-face
Tonight we're exploring a foreign place
Toe-to-toe, eye-to-eye
It's not taking long for you to realize
That I'm getting bored of holding hands
Baby I've got a new way to understand you
So I take my time, I won't rush
Let's communicate in ways, we can touch

[Chorus]
Cause I may only speak English
But another language I know is body
You're speechless
But I can hear you calling me loud and clear
You seem tense
So come on over
Let me know your body
Cause I know your heart
I know your mind, your soul
Give me something I can hold
Like your body

[Verse 2]
On the way we will find
Beauty in the simple things
We'll align so perfectly
I'm evident that you'll see
Love will be the only word we'll ever need
Cheek-to-cheek, mouth-to-mouth
Lost in translation every time I'm around you
I want to know what you're about
Don't worry about the words not coming out

[Chorus]
Cause I may only speak English
But another language I know is body
You're speechless
But I can hear you calling me loud and clear
You seem tense
So come on over
Let me know your body
Cause I know your heart
I know your mind, your soul
Give me something I can hold
Like your body

[Bridge]
Nowhere to run away, nowhere to hide
Show me what you're about
Inside and out

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah, we only speak English
But another language I know is body
(Know my body, show my body)
You're speechless
But I can hear you calling me loud and clear
You seem tense
So come on over
Let me know your body
Cause I know your heart
Your mind, your soul

[Chorus]
'Cause I may only speak English
But another language I know is body (your body)
You're speechless (oh baby I can hear you loud and clear)
But I can hear you calling me loud and clear
You seem to make no sense
So come over
Let me know your body
Cause I know your heart
I know your mind, your soul
Give me something I can hold

[Outro]
Na-na-na na-na-na na-na-na-na na-na-na na-na-na
Like your body
Na-na-na na-na-na-na-na na-na-na na-na-na
Like your body
Na-na-na na-na-na na-na-na-na na-na-na na-na-na
Like your body
Na-na-na na-na-na na-na-na-na na-na-na
