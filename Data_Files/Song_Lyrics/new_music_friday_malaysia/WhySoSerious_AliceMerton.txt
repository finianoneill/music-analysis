[Verse 1]
When did we forget
All the crazy things that made us feel so part of it?
Our youth, so confident
We played our heartstrings
Not caring if it ends

Try to learn to let go of all those things that tie you down
Get rid of it, the voice inside that tells me, there
I'm scared, yeah, scared as shit
But I wanna get let go of it now
So someone tell me

[Chorus]
Why so serious?
Why are we so serious?
Oh, why so serious?
When did we get like this?
I still remember we weren't grown up like this
Oooh, oh

[Verse 2]
I don't seem to get all the things that are happening
And I can't make sense of everything that's inside my head
But I keep on thinking, there's gotta be something said

Oh, seems we've lost it
That spark inside that tells us it's all nonsense
Stop being so cautious
With every mistake there comes a lesson learned
So someone tell me

[Chorus]
Why so serious? (Serious)
Why are we so serious?
Oh, why so serious? (Serious)
When did we get like this?
I still remember we weren't grown up like this
Oooh, oh

Why so serious? (Serious)
Why are we so serious?
Oh, why so serious? (Serious)
Can someone tell me
Did we forget about
Living with no regrets?
Oooh, oh

[Bridge]
I wanna live in the now
I'm not gonna live in the past
Don't wanna care about what-ifs
'Cause what if those things don't last?
And I wanna live with no regrets

I wanna live in the now
I'm not gonna live in the past
Don't wanna care about what-ifs
'Cause what if those things don't last?
And I wanna live with no regrets
So someone tell me

[Chorus]
Why so serious?
Why so serious? (Serious)
Why are we so serious?
Oh, why so serious? (Serious)
When did we get like this?
I still remember we weren't grown up like this
Oooh, oh

Why so serious? (Serious)
Why are we so serious?
Oh, why so serious? (Serious)
Can someone tell me
Did we forget about
Living with no regrets?
