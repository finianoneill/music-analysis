Hear that?
Oh my god, I’ll fill the coffee over!
Tear out
All my love until my blood runs sober

Oh, let me down
My body’s sinking, I can feel it now
Oh, hear me out
I’ve been thinking I won’t stick around

See that? Oh my god, I think we lost control!
Feel that?
Don’t mind me, I won’t be here for long

So please don’t tell me now
I swore it for you once and it gets me down
So please don’t tell me now

Oh, get me out!
My body’s shaking, but I don’t fear it now
I’ll sing it out, thank god you’re shrinking, ‘cause I won’t be around
So I would take a bow!
