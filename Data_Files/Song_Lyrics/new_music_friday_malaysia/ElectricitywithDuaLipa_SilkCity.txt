[Verse 1: Danielle Bradbery]
He pulled into that parking lot with them out of state tags
I fell in love before he unpacked his bags
One look, one smile, one 'what's your name?'
One 'what you doing later? Wanna grab a drink?'

[Chorus: Danielle Bradbery]
And it was hello summer, goodbye to my heart
Blue skies and blue eyes, a hell of a way to start
Letting him go would be the hardest part
Hello summer, goodbye to my heart
To my heart

[Verse 2: Thomas Rhett with Danielle Bradbery]
And who knew that one drink could turn into five?
Crazy how June burned into July
Tryna keep September from creeping in my head
Yeah, I knew what I was getting into the minute that I said

[Chorus: Danielle Bradbery & Thomas Rhett]
Hello summer, goodbye to my heart
Blue skies and blue eyes, a hell of a way to start
Letting him go would be the hardest part
Hello summer, goodbye to my heart
Oh, yeah

[Bridge: Danielle Bradbery with Thomas Rhett]
Yeah, he packed his bags, filled his tank with gas
Man, it went by so fast
Too good to last, yeah, just like that

[Pre-Chorus: Danielle Bradbery, Thomas Rhett, Both]
It was goodbye summer, you tore me apart
Blue eyes and blue skies fade into the dark
Letting go is the hardest part
Yeah

[Chorus: Danielle Bradbery & Thomas Rhett]
Hello summer, goodbye to my heart
Blue skies and blue eyes, a hell of a way to start
Letting him go will be the hardest part
Goodbye summer, hello to my broken heart
My broken heart, yeah
My broken heart (yeah)
To my broken heart, yeah

[Outro: Danielle Bradbery]
Goodbye summer
