[Chorus]
I can't be the only one
Who's lonely tonight
I can't be the only one

[Verse 1]
Who's drinking 'bout myself
Wishing that I was somewhere else
Talking to the voices in my head
Because at least they're listening
Right here's an easy place to hide
I stay in bed and shut the blinds
Don't even know where I would go

[Chorus]
But I know that there's gotta be somebody out there
There's gotta be somebody somewhere
Who needs company
And needs comforting to know
I can't be the only one
Who's lonely tonight
No, I can't be-

[Verse 2]
One with nobody to call
This city makes me feel so small
A million people in this town
But I could scream without a sound
So I get high to pass the time
Talk to someone I met online
To make myself feel less alone

[Chorus]
'Cause I know that there's gotta be somebody out there
There's gotta be somebody somewhere
Who needs company
And needs comforting to know
I can't be the only one
Who's lonely tonight
No, I can't be the only

[Post-Chorus]
No, I can't be the only one
Who's lonely tonight
No, I can't be the only one
Who's  lonely
No, I can't be the only
The only
