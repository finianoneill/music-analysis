[Verse 1]
I knew it was a bad idea
Getting involved with a side of romance
But maybe it's what I deserve
Getting attached with my match
And it hurts so bad
Oh, but when I saw you there
I thought you'd be fine
But easy to leave
I knew it was a bad idea
I knew it was a bad idea

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the only love I've ever had
I've seen the silhouette on my bed
Pouring it out, drinking it down
Taste so bitter

[Chorus]
I'm used to ripping hearts out
Now it's mine that's bleeding
Never let my guard down
Now I'm barely breathing
Never thought I'd be the one to fall
Now I'm in my castle all alone
Thought I was cool
But now I'm fucking freezing
Never felt alone
Now staring at the ceiling, feeling
What goes around, comes around
I'm tasting my medicine, tasting my medicine now
Tasting my medicine, tasting my medicine now
Tasting my medicine, tasting my medicine now

[Verse 2]
Karma delt a heavy hand
All too real, like a pill I can swallow
Before I didn't understand
And now I know how it feels to be hollow

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the only love I've ever had
I've seen the silhouette on my bed
Pouring it out, drinking it down
Taste so bitter

[Chorus]
I'm used to ripping hearts out
Now it's mine that's bleeding
Never let my guard down
Now I'm barely breathing
Never thought I'd be the one to fall
Now I'm in my castle all alone
Thought I was cool
But now I'm fucking freezing
Never felt alone
Now staring at the ceiling, feeling
What goes around, comes around
I'm tasting my medicine, tasting my medicine now
Tasting my medicine, tasting my medicine now
Tasting my medicine, tasting my medicine now

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the only love I've ever had
I've seen the silhouette on my bed
Pouring it out, drinking it down
Taste so bitter

[Chorus]
I'm used to ripping hearts out
Now it's mine that's bleeding
Never let my guard down
Now I'm barely breathing
Never thought I'd be the one to fall
Now I'm in my castle all alone
Thought I was cool
But now I'm fucking freezing
Never felt alone
Now staring at the ceiling, feeling
What goes around, comes around
I'm tasting my medicine, tasting my medicine now
Tasting my medicine, tasting my medicine now
Tasting my medicine, tasting my medicine now
Tasting my medicine, tasting my medicine now
Tasting my medicine, tasting my medicine now
