[Verse 1]
You started calling
But you never had a strength that it took to say
I do, I keep on falling
And if you knew that it could happen this way
Now you are seeking that cruel love
Looking back, it's just a bad luck
Always feels there is danger at the door
We could take a little more time out
But I don't wanna move backwards anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
People do bad things
To make themselves feel good
Treat you like a runway
While you’re face down in the mud

[Chorus]
I’ll never do that to you
You know I never would
We got something so good
Let’s leave behind the bad blood

[Verse 2]
And you started calling
See you with someone who wants it all the way (saw it all the way)
But this time, baby, let's go all-in
[?] turn ourselves where the ones to blame (where to blame)
That cruel love
Always feels like it's just a bad luck
Always feels there is danger at the door
Yeah, we could take a little more time out
But I don't wanna move backwards anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
People do bad things
To make themselves feel good
Treat you like a runway
While you’re face down in the mud

[Chorus]
I’ll never do that to you
You know I never would
Yeah, we got something so good
Let’s leave behind the bad blood

[Bridge]
Now fly to Paris
I'll be [?] in LA
We'll make your problems disappear
In this life there is things we have to face
But you don't have ever to fear

[Pre-Chorus]
People do bad things
To make themselves feel good
Treat you like a runway
While you’re face down in the mud

[Chorus]
I’ll never do that to you
You know I never could
Yeah, we got something so good
Let’s leave behind the bad blood
(I’ll never do that to you)
Let’s leave behind the bad blood
(I’ll never do that to you)
Bad blood
