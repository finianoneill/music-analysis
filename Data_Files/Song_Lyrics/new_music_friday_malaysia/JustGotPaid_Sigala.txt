[Verse 1]
I'm young for tonight
It's all under my control
I won't hesitate, it's my turn to make that call
I just want a touch
I ain't here for love no more
Okay, yeah

[Chorus]
I won't stop
Not now, guess what?
Hella, hella, it's my body right
I go-o-o in light
Hella, hella, it's my body
I'll dance if I want to

[Post-Chorus]
Hella, hella, it's my body
Hella, hella, it's my body

[Verse 2]
Some people do
But some they just like to talk, okay
Some shoot the breeze
But some like to leave a mic, okay
Some need the light
And some people like the dark, okay, yeah

[Chorus]
I won't stop
Not now, guess what?
Hella, hella, it's my body right
I go-o-o in light
Hella, hella, it's my body
I'll dance if I want to

[Post-Chorus]
Hella, hella, it's my body
Hella, hella, it's my body

[Bridge]
Gimme release, keep the drugs
Gimme relief
Keep the love, just gimme a piece of that
One piece of that
Give it to me
Don't judge, just give it to me
No heart, no second degree tonight
Run free tonight

[Chorus]
I'll dance if I want to
My hella, hella, it's my body
Hella, hella, it's my body
Body, body, and my body
Hella, hella, it's my body
Gonna dance if I want to, want to
Hella, hella, it's my body
