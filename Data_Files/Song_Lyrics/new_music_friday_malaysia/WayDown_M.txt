[Verse 1]
All of the day, all of the night
Flashing through my headlight
Lights in the sky and I'm gonna die
And I'm gonna be alright (mhmm)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I hear it like a call from the wild
And I keep putting coal on the fire
If I'm gonna lose my mind
Tell 'em I'ma do it with style

[Chorus]
Ooh, la la, ooh
I just wanna get fucked up with my baby
Ooh, la la, ooh
Tell 'em not to worry 'bout me
I'm on my way down
Ooh, la la, ooh
I just wanna get fucked up with my baby
Ooh, la la, ooh
Catch me on the bottom, oh
'Cause I'm on my way down

[Post-Chorus]
On my way down, on my way down
Time is up, time is up
Time is up, time is up
Time is up, time is up
Catch me on the bottom, oh
'Cause I'm on my way down
California

[Verse 2]
All of my life, been trying to find the little bit of paradise
So I'm gonna play a video game
I've never been a socialite (mhmm)
I'm just waiting for the stars to align
Yeah, I'm waiting for the stars to align

[Pre-Chorus]
If I'm gonna lose my mind
Tell 'em I'ma do it with style

[Chorus]
Ooh, la la, ooh
I just wanna get fucked up with my baby (baby)
Ooh, la la, ooh
Tell 'em not to worry 'bout me
I'm on my way down (on my way down)
Ooh, la la, ooh
I just wanna get fucked up with my baby (baby)
Ooh, la la, ooh
Catch me on the bottom, oh
'Cause I'm on my way down

[Post-Chorus]
On my way down, on my way down
Time is up, time is up
Time is up, time is up
Time is up, time is up
Catch me on the bottom, oh
'Cause I'm on my way down

[Bridge]
I'm, I'm on my way
I'm, I'm on my way down
I'm, I'm on my way
We should be together when we go down
I'm, I'm on my way
I'm, I'm on my way down
I'm, I'm on my way

[Outro]
Catch me on the bottom, oh
'Cause I'm on my way down
On my way down
Time is up, time is up
Catch me on the bottom, oh
'Cause I'm on my way down
California, where your dreams will come true
