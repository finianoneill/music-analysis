Where do i start babe
I don’t know
But your a star babe
Of That I’m sure
How did you get down here?
Heaven mourns
As another angel falls
But she's fallen on to me

PRE
Ive never been someone to make my feelings known
(had a heart stone)
But i don't know whats coming over me

CH
The Truth Is
I can't hide it
I can't hold it in no more
The truth is
That Your Body
Only Your Body is the cure
I don’t want you
I need you, I need you
And i never get enough
Truth is
Truth is
I Can't Live without you girl

V2
Having My heart broken
All the time
Only a man hoping
For some one kind
But with your Holy Water washing over of me
I’m baptised, I’m new
Loving you
Gives me air to breath

CH
The Truth Is
I can't hide it
I can't hold it in no more
The truth is
That Your Body
Only Your Body is the cure
I don’t want you
I need you, I need you
And i never get enough
Truth is
Truth is
I Can't Live without you girl

The Truth is
Life had no meaning
My Life it had no meaning
The Truth is
Then you Came in
Showed me all id been missing
