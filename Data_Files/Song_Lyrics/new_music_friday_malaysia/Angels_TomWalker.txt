[Verse 1]
Save praise for a better man
No need for your touching hands
There's nothing to understand
I'm home with the lost and damned

[Refrain]
Long road and you're on your own
Take care of my broken soul
'Cause there must be
Well there must be

[Verse 2]
What I drink out of remedies
Too young for these memories
Swing low to the melodies
Far so from the teeth of the enemy

[Refrain]
Long road and you're on your own
Take care of my broken soul

[Chorus]
'Cause there must be
Well there must be angels, guiding the way
Well there must be angels, saving our grace
Well there must be heaven for people who stray
Well there must be heaven in this hell that I'm livin'
'Cause heaven seems to be so forgiving

[Post-Chorus]
So don't give up
Well I, I won't give up
No, now don't give up
Well I- 'Cause there must be angels
Well there must be angels
Well there must be heaven in this hell that I'm livin'
'Cause heaven seems to be so forgiving

[Verse 3]
Well, let's hope keeping dreams afloat
And I stand, just a man, on a tightrope
Dull fate but I'll never know
And I see wings when I look through my telescope

[Refrain]
Long road and you're on your own
Take care of my broken soul

[Chorus]
'Cause there must be
Well there must be angels, guiding the way
Well there must be angels, saving our grace
Well there must be heaven for people who stray
Well there must be heaven in this hell that I'm livin'
'Cause heaven seems to be so forgiving

[Post-Chorus]
So don't give up
Well I, I won't give up
No, now don't give up
Well I- 'Cause there must be angels
Well there must be angels
Well there must be heaven in this hell that I'm livin'
'Cause heaven seems to be so forgiving

[Outro]
Well, don't give up
I, I, Well I won't give up
No, Don't give up
I, Well I won't give up
'Cause there must be angels
Well there must be heaven in this hell that I'm livin'
'Cause heaven seems to be so forgiving
I, I-
