[Intro: Shannen Doherty & Winona Ryder]
"Veronica, you look like hell." "Yeah? I just got back." "Veronica, what are you doing?" "Heather, my love-"

[Verse 1: L Devine & Winona Ryder]
Now that I'm at 20 years, hell is where I'm living
I don't know how to cope with all the existential thinking
I never used to give a shit but now it's all I'm giving
Now it's all I'm giving
The party's in an hour but I'm crying in a towel
'Cause this fucking picture doesn't even look like me now
Took a couple uppers
That's what they do when they feel down
"Heather, my love-"

[Chorus: L Devine]
Peer pressure
Nothin’ gonna save me
Run run run run run run run
Peer pressure
Got me going crazy
Run run run run run run run
Peer pressure
How you gonna take me
Run run run run run run run
Peer pressure
I'm trying but it's hard to explain
Peer pressure let me swallow the pain

[Verse 2: L Devine]
I got so many friends and they all make me feel alone
They always say they love me but I know they really don't
I just suck it up and do whatever they want
Tell me what I want
I lost all my money so that I could look like you
Where's my personality? I guess I lost that too
It doesn't really matter, that's what we're supposed to do
When I'm under the influence

[Chorus: L Devine]
Peer pressure
Nothin’ gonna save me
Run run run run run run run
Peer pressure
Got me going crazy
Run run run run run run run
Peer pressure
How you gonna take me
Run run run run run run run
Peer pressure
I'm trying but it's hard to explain
Peer pressure let me swallow the pain

[Bridge: L Devine]
I'm so numb
I'm under the influence
So much fun when I'm under the influence
(Peer pressure)
I'm so numb
I'm under the influence
So much fun when I'm under the influence

Now that I'm at 20 years, hell is where I'm living
I don't know how to cope with all the existential thinking
Never used to give a shit but now it's all I'm giving
But now it's all I'm-

[Chorus: L Devine]
Peer pressure
Nothin’ gonna save me
Run run run run run run run
Peer pressure
Got me going crazy
Run run run run run run run
Peer pressure
How you gonna take me
Run run run run run run run
Peer pressure
Got me going crazy
Run run run run run run run
Peer pressure

[Outro: L Devine]
I'm so numb
I'm under the influence
(Peer pressure)
So much fun when I'm under the influence
(Peer pressure)
I'm so numb
I'm under the influence
(Peer pressure)
So much fun when I'm under the influence
