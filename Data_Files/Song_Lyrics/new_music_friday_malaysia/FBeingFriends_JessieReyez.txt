[Verse 1]
Fuck being friends
Fuck being friends (we don't pretend)
I got your heart in my hand and you think anoeht
You ain't scared a fuck but you scared of being lovers
Who's there, huh?

[Chorus]
My pussy beat better then your heart do
Woah, please don't blame you're a smart dude
So why you pussy fucking on this part two?
No, you didn't call me just to hug you
You still love me, oh, oh, oh
You suck while play dumb you still love me, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Why you worried if your friend turned up tryna fuck me
Hold you in my phone? Uh
Hold up, hold up in my ass
You suck while play dumb you still love me
Oh, oh, oh

[Hook]
Fuck me crazy bitch
Fuck me bitch, fuck me bitch
Fuck being friends
Fuck being friends
Fuck being friends
Fuck being friends

[Verse 2]
You stood up with your head up
I was doing bed and you knew it so you caught me
And you start to feel again, you just scared of fall, why?
Stair, huh?

[Chorus]
My pussy beat better th your heart do
Woah, please don't blame you're a smart dude
So why you pussy fucking on this part two?
No, you didn't call me just to hug you
You still love me, oh, oh, oh
You suck while play dumb you still love me, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Why you worried if your friend turned up tryna fuck me
Hold you in my phone? Uh
Hold up, hold up in my ass
You suck while play dumb you still love me
Oh, oh, oh

Fuck me crazy bitch
Fuck me bitch, fuck me bitch
