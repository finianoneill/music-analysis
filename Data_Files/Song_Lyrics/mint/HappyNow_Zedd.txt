[Chorus]
I'll go anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
I'll ride, I'll ride away with you

[Verse 1]
We were following the Cambridge signs
Trynna get the music right
In my shitty old car with the scratched up sides
Open windows all the way
'Coz I ain't got no AC, babe
Let the radio sing what we would say

[Pre-Chorus]
'Coz Sundays last forever
When I got you, baby
If you're driving with me

[Chorus]
I'll go anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
I'll ride, I'll ride away with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
I'll ride, I'll ride away with you, you, you, you...
I'll ride, I'll ride away with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
I'll ride, I'll ride away with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
I'll ride, I'll ride away with you
I'll ride, I'll ride away with you

[Verse 2]
Looking for a pick me up
I don't really want to stop
I'm driving fast, got a buzz from the coffee cups
Only filled the tank half up
So I could spend the rest on us
Don't need gas, got enough, we running on love

[Pre-Chorus]
'Coz Sundays last forever
Yeah, I'm glad you saved me
If you're driving with me

[Chorus]
I'll go anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
I'll ride, I'll ride away with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
I'll ride, I'll ride away with you, you, you, you...
I'll go anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
I'll ride, I'll ride away with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
I'll ride, I'll ride away with you

[Bridge]
'Coz Sundays last forever
When I got you, baby
When you're driving with me
You always make it better
Yeah, I'm glad you saved me
If you're driving with me

[Chorus]
I'll go anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
I'll ride, I'll ride away with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
I'll ride, I'll ride away with you

[Outro]
I'll ride away with you, you
I'll ride away with you
I'll ride away with you, you
I'll ride away
I'll ride, I'll ride away with you
