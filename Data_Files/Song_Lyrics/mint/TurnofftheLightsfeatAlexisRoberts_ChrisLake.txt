[Pre-Chorus]
Diamonds, they're fake
Your words are seeking
Die, die in my chest
So what are you thinking?

[Chorus]
I don't know you anymore
We're alone out now
And before you go
Just turn off the lights

[Post-Chorus]
Just turn off the lights
Just turn off the lights

[Chorus]
I don't know you anymore
We're alone out now
And before you go
Just turn off the lights

[Post-Chorus]
Just turn off the lights
Just turn off the lights

[Pre-Chorus]
Diamonds, they're fake
Your words are seeking
Die, die in my chest
So what are you thinking?

[Chorus]
I don't know you anymore
We're alone out now
And before you go
Just turn off the lights

[Post-Chorus]
Turn off the
Turn off the
Turn off the
Turn off the

Turn off the, turn off the
Turn off the, turn off the

Turn off
Turn off
Turn off
Turn off the lights

Just turn off the lights
Just turn off the lights
