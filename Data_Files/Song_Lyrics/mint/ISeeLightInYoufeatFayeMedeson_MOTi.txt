[Verse 1]
I see light in you
The things you say you're gonna do you do
Yeah, I see light in you
There's no deception

I see light in you
You bring the sun
Yeah, you light up the room
I would take care of you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I see light in you
I see light in you

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
I see light in you
The things you say you're gonna do you do
Yeah, I see light in you
There's no deception

I see light in you
You bring the sun
Yeah, you light up the room
I would take care of you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I see light in you
I see light in you

[Instrumental]

I see light in you
