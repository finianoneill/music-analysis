[Intro]
Welcome to the...
Welcome to the...
Welcome to the...
Welcome to the...

[Verse 1]
Hell raising, hair raising
I'm ready for the worst
So frightening, face whitening
Fear that you can't reverse

[Pre-Chorus]
My phone has no signal
It's making my skin crawl
The silence is so loud
The lights spark and flicker
With monsters much bigger
Than I can control now

[Chorus]
Welcome to the panic room
Where all your darkest fears are gonna
Come for you, come for you
Welcome to the panic room
You'll know I wasn't joking
When you see them too, see them too

[Post-Chorus]
Welcome to the panic room
Welcome to the...
Welcome to the...
Welcome to the...
Welcome to the...

[Verse 2]
Still waiting, hands shaking
Maybe the coast will clear
But these voices, these strange noises
They followed me in here

[Pre-Chorus]
My phone has no signal
It's making my skin crawl
The silence is so loud
The lights spark and flicker
With monsters much bigger
Than I can control now

[Chorus]
Welcome to the panic room
Where all your darkest fears are gonna
Come for you, come for you
Welcome to the panic room
You'll know I wasn't joking
When you see them too, see them too

[Post-Chorus]
Welcome to the panic room
Welcome to the...
Welcome to the...

[Bridge]
There's no crying wolves now
'Cause the truth has settled in
Hiding under goose down
For your nightmare to begin
There's no crying wolves now
Welcome to the...
Welcome to the...
'Cause the truth has settled in
Welcome to the...
Welcome to the...
Hiding under goose down
Welcome to the...
Welcome to the...
For your nightmare to begin
Welcome to the...
Welcome to the...

[Chorus]
Welcome to the panic room
Where all your darkest fears are gonna
Come for you, come for you
Welcome to the panic room
You'll know I wasn't joking
When you see them too, see them too

[Post-Chorus]
Welcome to the panic room
Welcome to the...
Welcome to the...

[Outro]
Hell raising, hair raising
I'm ready for the worst
