[Verse: Stefflon Don]
Still I pu-pull up in the Benz wid tha all gold ting
Window down, see me with ma king
Still I pu-pull up in the Benz wid tha all gold ting
Window down, see me with ma king
Still I pu-pull up in the Benz wid tha all gold ting
Window down, see me with ma king
Still I pu-pull up in the Benz wid tha all gold ting
Window down, see me with ma king
Still I pu-pull up in the Benz wid tha all gold ting
Window down, see me with ma king
Still I pu-pull up in the Benz wid tha all gold ting

[Chorus: Halsey]
I’m still alone in my mind, I’m still alone
I’m still alone in my mind, I’m still alone
I’m still alone in my mind, I’m still alone
I’m still alone in my mind, I’m still alone

[Verse: Stefflon Don]
Still I pu-pull up in the Benz wid tha all-gold ting
Window down, see me with ma king
Still I pu-pull up in the Benz wid tha all-gold ting
Window down, see me with ma king
Still I pu-pull up in the Benz wid tha all-gold ting
Window down, see me with ma king
Still I pu-pull up in the Benz wid tha all-gold ting
Wid tha all-gold ting, wid tha all-gold ting, wid tha all-gold ting
