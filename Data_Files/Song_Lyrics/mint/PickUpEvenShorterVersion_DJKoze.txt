[Verse 1]
I promise I won't waste your time
Leave it up to me and I will blow your mind
I know the moment when you set me free
'Cause I've been to hell and back
This looks like heaven to me
I've seen some lows and highs
We all lose our way more than once or twice
I know how powerful we could be
'Cause I've been to hell and back
This looks like heaven to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Heaven to me, heaven to me
Heaven to me, heaven to me
Heaven to me, heaven to me
Heaven to me, heaven to me
Heaven to me, heaven to me

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been to hell and back
This looks like heaven to me (heaven to me)
This looks like heaven to me (heaven to me)

[Verse 2]
I'm standing on cloud nine
You take away the gray and leave me with sunshine
I can't believe I feel it finally
'Cause I've been to hell and back
This looks like heaven to me
I've seen the darkest days
That's how I know this is the time and place
And you're the only one to set me free
'Cause I've been to hell and back
This looks like heaven to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Heaven to me, heaven to me
Heaven to me, heaven to me
Heaven to me, heaven to me
Heaven to me, heaven to me
Heaven to me, heaven to me

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been to hell and back
This looks like heaven to me (heaven to me)
This looks like heaven to me (heaven to me)
