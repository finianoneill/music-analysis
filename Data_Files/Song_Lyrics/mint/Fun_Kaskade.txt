[Verse 1: Madge]
I wanna go out
Dress up real nice and find someone
Who's ready to run
But, most of all
I wanna have some fun

[Chorus: Madge]
I wanna have some fun
I wanna have some fun
I wanna have some fun
Fun, fun
I wanna have some
I wanna have some fun

[Drop: Madge]
I wanna have some fun
Fun, fun, fun

[Verse 2: Madge]
I wanna go out (I wanna go out)
Dress up real nice (Dress up real nice)
And find someone (And find someone)
Who's ready to run (Who's ready to run)
But, most of all
I wanna have some fun

[Chorus 2: Madge]
I wanna have some fun
I wanna have some fun
I wanna have some fun, fun, fun
I wanna have some fun, fun, fun...
I wanna have some fun, fun...
I wanna have some fun

[Drop: Madge]
I wanna have some fun
I wanna have some... fun, fun, fun...
I wanna have some fun
