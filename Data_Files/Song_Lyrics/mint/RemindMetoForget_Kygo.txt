[Verse]
Here I'll stay, waiting for the tide to turn
And sail away, all these breaking waves of hurt
I'll try to leave behind this savage world
Maybe someday I'll return
Patiently, you wait for me on the shore
Thinking time is all I need to give you more
But guarantees, I can't give you no
'Cause I'm a shipwreck sinking slowly

[Pre-Chorus]
And promises they break
And I'm through making mistakes
Well, love's done nothing but cut me up
And carry me away

[Chorus]
So now I hide my heart
It's buried somewhere deep at the bottom of the ocean
'Cause I've been torn apart
And what I thought was love nearly left me broken
So now I hide my heart
Far beneath the waves at the bottom of the ocean
If only I could get to you
What's swimming beneath the blue of this ocean

[Pre-Chorus]
And promises they break
And I'm through making mistakes
Well, love's done nothing but cut me up
And carry me away

[Chorus]
So now I hide my heart
It's buried somewhere deep at the bottom of the ocean
'Cause I've been torn apart
And what I thought was love nearly left me broken
So now I hide my heart
Far beneath the waves at the bottom of the ocean
If only I could get to you
What's swimming beneath the blue of this ocean

[Outro]
At the bottom of this ocean
