[Verse 1]
Go to town with it
And she shave it all off, Charlie Brown with it
Lookin' all around, all the other girls sound fishy
He ain't ever caught a whiff, that's why he down with it
Yuh, bitch, I'm tellin' you, this incredible, this shit edible
It's like caramel, kiss my genital
Might taste medical mayday
Her's like chemicals ayy, ayy
If he gay, the way he taste, that shit turn hetero
(Oh my God)
Can you see that she need kneepads?
I'm a bad bitch, fuck a pee-pad
Full of shit, if he don't eat it, he a D-bag
He could use a submarine, I'll call him seaman

[Pre-Chorus]
If you're down, boy, really down
Baby, let me watch you go to town
It's your one chance, baby, never or now, yeah
Let me see you go to town, baby
Go to town, yeah
Baby, let me watch you go to town

[Verse 2]
D to the TF, got your BF in my DMs
Got him all up in my hair, but it's not all mine, 'cause a bitch love FreeTress
So look, baby, don't lie, 'cause I can't believe my eyes
And her man between my thighs, whole time, yeah, I do my DIYs
And it's clean, but messy like a pizza
Spend time on the donkey, even though I yeehaw
Call her chunky monkey, I be textin' peaches
He text me an eggplant, I text him a peanut

[Pre-Chorus]
If you're down, boy, really down
Baby, let me watch you go to town
It's your one chance, baby, never or now, yeah
Let me see you go to town, baby

Baby, let me watch you go to town
It's your one chance, baby, never or now, yeah, yeah, yeah

Go down, go down, go down, yeah
Baby, see you go down
Let me see you go to town, yeah
Go down, go down, go down, yeah
