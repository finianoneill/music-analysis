[Verse 1]
Seaside
I'm running around looking for peace of mind
So come out and change me
You were always around to make me smile

[Chorus]
Stuck underwater
I'm stuck underwater
I just need some space
My friend
It’s not what you wanted
It’s not what you wanted
But I just need a change
Again
Help me out before I die
Save me now before I give up
Help me out before I drown
Yeah I just need some

[Verse 2]
Inside
I'm drifting around watching the birds fly by
So come out and shake me
I'm caught in the waves pulling me down

[Chorus]
Stuck underwater
I'm stuck underwater
I just need some space
My friend
It’s not what you wanted
It’s not what you wanted
But I just need a change
Again
Help me out before I drown
Save me now before I give up
Help me out before I drown
'Cause I just need some space

[Chorus]
Stuck underwater
I'm stuck underwater
I just need some space
My friend
It’s not what you wanted
It’s not what you wanted
But I just need a change
Again
Help me out before I die
Save me now before I give up
Help me out before I drown
'Cause I just need some space
Ya I just need some space
