[Verse 1: Cali Dixon]
Can't go out
When faces and places
Leave more than just these traces of you
I'm worn out
Oh, I don't want you here
But I just can't learn to love someone else

[Pre-Chorus: Gabe Neal]
(I know)
I can't get you off of my mind
Wasting all of this time
Hoping one of these bodies
Will get me through this party
And I'll forget about you
All this shit you do
I really miss the way I loved you

[Chorus: Cali Dixon & Both]
You can call me crazy
I'll just call you baby
I really shouldn't pick up the phone
'Cause texting leads to talking
And talking leads to loving
In my sheets, my sheets
I’ll love you all night long
All night long

[Verse 2: Gabe Neal]
I'm fed up
With all these pretty faces
'Cause no one seems to look like you do
I messed up
I know I said those things last summer
But you know I, know I
Just miss you all the time

[Pre-chorus: Cali Dixon & Gabe Neal]
'Cause I
Can't get you off of my mind
Wasting all of this time
Hoping one of these bodies
Will get me through this party
And I'll forget about you
All the shit you do
I really miss the way I loved

[Chorus: Cali Dixon & Both]
You can call me crazy
I'll just call you baby
I really shouldn't pick up the phone
'Cause texting leads to talking
And talking leads to loving
In my sheets, my sheets
I'll love you all night long
All night long

[Bridge: Gabe Neal & Cali Dixon]
I'll just hit you up at 2 A.M. just to talk
You know better
I know better
And I'll just say a million things
To get you off my mind
No better

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
You can call me crazy
I'll just call you baby
I really shouldn't pick up the phone, mm
Cause texting leads to talking
And talking leads to loving
In my sheets, my sheets
I’ll love you all night long

[Outro: Cali Dixon & Gabe Neal]
(Texting leads to talking)
(And talking leads to loving)
All night long
(Texting leads to talking)
(And talking leads to loving)
All night long
(Texting leads to talking)
(And talking leads to loving)
All night long
(Texting leads to talking)
(And talking leads to loving)
(All night long)
