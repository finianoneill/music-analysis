[Intro]
(Woah)
I've been up five days, I can't get no rest
Menoh
I've been up five days, I can't get no, ayy (I can't get no rest, I can't get no rest)
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
I've been up five days, I can't get no rest
Stay inside my house, dodgin' questions from the press
She gon' fall in love, my nigga, what did you expect?
Everybody love you when they know that you got next
Got my gang with me, we on that fuck shit
She didn't like me then, now she wanna suck it
I don't got no time, get my cash in abundance
Book me for a show, I hit your stage and get it jumpin'

[Post-Chorus]
Bitch, I got on Balenciaga
He said he ridin', I don't know him, that boy not my partner
My bitch a queen, she took a pic, look like the new Madonna
Hopped out the foreign, cracked his head, that boy look like piñata
Go crazy for them dollars, ayy, ayy

[Verse]
I don't got no time for these lames in my face
I'ma take the trophy and go put it in a case
You were talkin' down, but you just look like a disgrace
I'ma grab the choppa, get the bullets out the vase
'Fore them niggas talkin', they don't want no smoke
When I used to come around, they'd play me for a joke
Now she wanna suck and put my Johnny in her throat
I go barely in and shawty callin' me the G.O.A.T
I'm the big man, I count big bands
You sinkin', quicksand, she on a handstand
I got my brothers with me, try me, you actin' silly
Love me, but wanna kill me
Know they all gonna feel me, ah

[Chorus]
I've been up five days, I can't get no rest
Stay inside my house, dodgin' questions from the press
She gon' fall in love, my nigga, what did you expect?
Everybody love you when they know that you got next
Got my gang with me, we on that fuck shit
She didn't like me then, now she wanna suck it
I don't got no time, get my cash in abundance
Book me for a show, I hit your stage and get it jumpin'

[Post-Chorus]
Bitch, I got on Balenciaga
He said he ridin', I don't know him, that boy not my partner
My bitch a queen, she took a pic, look like the new Madonna
Hopped out the foreign, cracked his head, that boy look like piñata
Go crazy for them dollars, ah

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I've been up five days, I can't get no rest
Stay inside my house, dodgin' questions from the press
She gon' fall in love, my nigga, what did you expect?
Everybody love you when they know that you got next
Got my gang with me, we on that fuck shit
She didn't like me then, now she wanna suck it
I don't got no time, get my cash in abundance
Book me for a show, I hit your stage and get it jumpin'

[Post-Chorus]
Bitch, I got on Balenciaga
He said he ridin', I don't know him, that boy not my partner
My bitch a queen, she took a pic, look like the new Madonna
Hopped out the foreign, cracked his head, that boy look like piñata
Go crazy for them dollars, ah
