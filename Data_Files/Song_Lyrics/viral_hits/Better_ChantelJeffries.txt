[Chorus: Vory]
I know he did you wrong, I can do you better
You tryna act like you don't do dirt
I know he did you wrong, I can do you better
You know that he don't need you
If he gets the chance he'll leave you

I know he did you wrong, I can do you better
You tryna act like you don't do dirt
I know he did you wrong, I can do you better
You know that he don't need you
If he gets the chance he'll leave you

[Verse 1: Vory]
I put me last but you first, ya
You drag my name in the dirt, ya
Always saying that I don't deserve ya
I put in work, it didn't work, ya
You like to see me at my worst, ya
You never take my word, yeah ya
Tell me, am I ever when you're mind? Ya
Tell me, is this always a waste of time? Ya
Tell me, why must I remind ya? Yeah
But I ain't really tryna cross that line, ya

[Chorus: Vory]
I know he did you wrong, I can do you better
You tryna act like you don't do dirt
I know he did you wrong, I can do you better
You know that he don't need you
If he gets the chance he'll leave you

I know he did you wrong, I can do you better
You tryna act like you don't do dirt
I know he did you wrong, I can do you better
You know that he don't need you
If he gets the chance he'll leave you

[Verse 2: BlocBoy JB]
I ain't gon' leave ya
I just wanna please ya
Girl, you know that your body is a teaser
Make it shake like a seizure
Ay, rob a nigga in my shell toe Adidas
Yeah, you know the procedure
Yeah, you know I'm 'bout green like PETA
Got them keys like Alicia
Bitch, I'm a king I feel like Coretta
Martin Luther King had a dream too
I was serving dope to the fiend too
Ay, I'ma jump ya like a pogo
Smoking on that gas, got a nigga in his mojo
I just spilled some lean on my Louis V polo
Fresh Ice T like a nigga need coco

[Chorus: Vory]
I know he did you wrong, I can do you better
You tryna act like you don't do dirt
I know he did you wrong, I can do you better
You know that he don't need you
If he gets the chance he'll leave you

I know he did you wrong, I can do you better
You tryna act like you don't do dirt
I know he did you wrong, I can do you better
You know that he don't need you
If he gets the chance he'll leave you
