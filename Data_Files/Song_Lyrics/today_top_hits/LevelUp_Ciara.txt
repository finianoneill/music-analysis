All this on me so yummy, all this sauce so yummy
Know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy

[Verse 1]
Them old mistakes are gone, I won’t do them no more
That’s old news, there’s new news, I done did that before
I turned nothing to something, my comeback on one hunnid'
Less talking, more action, you just gon' see Ci coming
I just keep elevating, no losses, just upgrading
My lessons, made blessings, I turned that into money
Thank God I never settled, this view is so much better
I’m chilling, I’m winning, like on another level

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you can talk all you want
See me, I stayed prayed up
Nothing I’m afraid of
And I can have it all

[Chorus]
Five, four, three, two, one
Leggo! (watch me)
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up

Know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me so yummy, all this sauce so yummy
Know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy

[Verse 2]
Fake friends get dropped like weight (oh)

Up, up, up on my way (aye)
Thank God I never settled (nope)
This view is so much better
