[Intro: David Banner]
D.A got that dope
Cum girl, I'm tryna get your pussy wet
Cum girl, I'm tryna get your pussy wet

[Verse 1: Tyga & David Banner]
Okay, so high and I'm lookin' at my Rollie time
Fucked her once gotta call her for the seventh time
So sincere but don't get out of line
A.I. in his prime, Harden at the line
Swish, do it on me all night
Yeah, I wanna bust it down until it's daylight
How you keep your toes white and the pussy tight
Ohh, the 42 got you feelin' nice
Ohh, Kawasaki 'bout to lick her bike (uh)
Rich, rich, they rich, you know what I like
Cum girl, g-go in overtime
Girl you look good, won't you, you know the line
Cum girl, I'm tryna get your pussy wet

[Chorus: Tyga & David Banner]
Uh, ba-back that ass
Uh, ba-back that ass
Girl you look good when you back that ass
Cum girl, I'm tryna get your pussy wet
Uh, ba-back that ass
Uh, ba-back that ass, girl you look good, make me spend that cash

[Verse 2: Tyga & David Banner]
Finger fuckin' money, finger bangin' to the hunnid (hah)
If you act like you want it, I can put you on it
Too blessed to be stress, sex in the morning
You can have my t-shirt if you really want it
Trunk in the front, pop that, pop that, pop that, pop, pop, pop that
If I gave you my number, better hold that
In the party goin' dumb, whole squad max
And I just threw, 20 in the strip
Ayy, ayy, CV on my wrist
Ayy, ayy, hunnid on my neck
Bling, bling, saucy with the drip
Could it be my cash, why you on my dick
Cum girl, I'm tryna get your pussy wet
Cum girl, I'm tryna get your pussy wet
Cum girl, I'm tryna get your pussy wet
Cum girl, I'm tryna get your pussy wet

[Chorus: Tyga & David Banner]
Uh, ba-back that ass
Uh, ba-back that ass
Girl you look good when you back that ass
Cum girl, I'm tryna get your pussy wet
Uh, ba-back that ass
Uh, ba-back that ass, girl you look good, make me spend that cash

[Bridge: Tyga, David Banner & Sissy Nobby]
Gitty up, and gitty up, and gitty up and gitty up and gitty up
And gitty up, and gitty up, and gitty up and
Cum girl, I'm tryna get your pussy wet
Gitty up, and gitty up, and gitty up and gitty up and gitty up
And gitty up, and gitty up, and gitty up and
Bend that, bend that, bend that ca-
Bend that, bend that, bend that (hah, hah)
Bend that
Pop, pop, pop that
Cum girl, I'm tryna get your pussy wet

[Chorus: Tyga & David Banner]
Uh, ba-back that ass
Uh, ba-back that ass
Girl you look good when you back that ass
Cum girl, I'm tryna get your pussy wet
Uh, ba-back that ass
Uh, ba-back that ass, girl you look good, make me spend that cash

[Outro: Tyga]
Could it be my cash
And I just threw 20 in the strip
Could it be my cash
And I just threw 20 in the strip
